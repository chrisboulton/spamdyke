VERSION 4.1.0: 7/3/2010
  Changed the option "hostname-file" to read /var/qmail/control/me by default.
  Added the option "dns-resolv-conf" to read the nameserver from a file other
    than /etc/resolv.conf if necessary.  Multiple files can be read, if needed.
  Changed all uses of strncpy() to memcpy() because strncpy() will fill the
    remainder of the destination buffer with zeroes if the source string is
    too short.  This is not needed because all strings are being explicitly
    terminated after copies anyway.
  Added two new parameters to search_file() to allow the matching line data to
    be returned to the caller.
  Changed process_access() to save the contents of the RELAYCLIENT environment
    variable, if set.
  Added the timefilter program to the utils folder.
  Reversed a small change to spamdyke_log() made 4.0.8 that will prevent buffer
    overflows in obscure situations.
  Changed is_ip_in_name() to look for more patterns of IP addresses in rDNS
    names: 044.033.022.011, 44.033.022.011, 44.33.022.011 and 44.33.22.011.
    Thanks to Eduard Svarc for suggesting this one.
  Changed the syslog output to include an "encryption:" tag at the end that
    shows the current status of TLS/SSL encryption.  Thanks to Eric Shubert for
    suggesting this one.
  Added a "-R" option to smtpdummy so it will reject all recipients.
  Completely rewrote find_address() to completely conform to RFC 2822 when
    parsing addresses, including quoting, comments, folded whitespace and
    all the rest.
  Added the option "reject-identical-sender-recipient" to block any messages
    where the sender and recipient are the same.  Thanks to almost everyone
    on the mailing list for suggesting this one.
  Changed nihdns_mx() to tolerate MX records that contain IP addresses (illegal)
    instead of names.
  Fixed Makefile.in to use the CPPFLAGS variable from the "configure" script, if
    the user provided it in an environment variable.  Thanks to Iavor Stoev for
    reporting this one.
  Fixed the "configure" script to correctly include header files on FreeBSD 7.0.
    Thanks to Andrew Khon for reporting this one.
  Added a "-S" flag to sendrecv to prevent it from starting a TLS session when
    it sees "STARTTLS".
  Improved sendrecv's usage display to document what each option does.
  Changed do_spamdyke() to set the stdin and stdout file descriptors to
    nonblocking before calling middleman().  This works around a bug in the SSL
    library that will block forever waiting for input, even after SSL_pending()
    and/or select() has already indicated the socket is ready.  Thanks to
    Teodor Milkov for identifying this problem more than a year ago and trog for
    producing a patch to fix it!
  Fixed process_config_file() to reject configuration file lines with
    bad/missing characters.
  Fixed process_config_file() to print an "unknown option" error message instead
    of an "illegal option" message when an unknown option is found in a
    configuration file.
  Added option "rejection-text-identical-sender-recipient" to set the rejection
    message for the identical sender/recipient filter.
  Created dnsdummy to simulate a nameserver but exit after a short while for
    testing spamdyke's DNS routines.
  Converted all DNS-related tests to use dnsdummy and removed all references to
    spamdyke.org and silence.org.  This will also allow the removal of the
    (hundreds of) bogus entries from the spamdyke.org zone file.
  Removed the use of getprotobyname() from dns.c and used the defined protocol
    values in netinet/in.h.
  Changed nihdns_query() to retry DNS queries via TCP if the response received
    via UDP has the "truncation" flag set (indicating the answers are too large
    for a UDP packet).  Thanks to Roland Moelle for suggesting this one.
  Added option "dns-tcp" to control if spamdyke will retry DNS queries via TCP.
  Added option "dns-spoof" to control if spamdyke will attempt to detect DNS
    spoofing and, if so, what it should do about it.
  Fixed smtp_filter() to offer and accept SMTP AUTH (when appropriate) even if
    the connection is already whitelisted.  Thanks to Ratko Rudic for
    reporting this one.

VERSION 4.0.10: 12/17/2008
  Added a parameter to nihdns_a() to return the IP address to the caller.
  Changed do_spamdyke() to assume the value of TCPREMOTEIP is a name if it
    can't be parsed as an IP address.  It will now search for an A record and
    use the results (if any) as the remote IP address.  The environment will
    also be updated to contain the IP address, so child processes won't have
    to repeat this work.  This works around a bug in Plesk 9 that sets
    TCPREMOTEIP to "localhost" for local connections.  Thanks to Medovarszky
    Zoltan and Christian Aust for reporting this one.

VERSION 4.0.9: 12/1/2008
  Fixed examine_entry() to repeatedly search for matches within the target
    string instead of stopping after the first one.  This bug was preventing
    blacklist entries like "@example.com" from matching
    "foo.example.com@example.com".  Thanks to John Devenport for reporting this
    one.
  Fixed config_test_spamdyke_binary() to actually search the PATH instead of
    just repeatedly checking for the binary in the current directory.  This was
    a cut-and-paste error.  Thanks to John Hallam for reporting this one.
  Fixed config_test_spamdyke_binary() to check if the object it found is really
    an executable before checking its permissions.
  Added some extra debugging output to find_environment_variable(),
    config_test_spamdyke_binary() and find_path().

VERSION 4.0.8: 11/5/2008
  Changed spamdyke_log() to send all messages to stderr (when appropriate) using
    a single call to vfprintf() by adding newline characters and PID prefixes to
    the format before outputting anything.  This is necessary to work around a
    problem with the design of DJB's multilog program, which uses a single pipe
    to accept input from all processes and thus cannot keep log messages
    separate.  This means partial output from some spamdyke processes could
    overlap output from other spamdyke processes when the load rises (a race
    condition).  Thanks to Philip Nix Guru for reporting this one.

VERSION 4.0.7: 10/17/2008
  Changed Makefile.in to compile configuration.c in two steps: first use gcc
    to produce the preprocessed source, then use gcc to compile it.  For some
    reason, gcc crashes on FreeBSD 6.0 when the file is compiled in one step.
    Thanks to K. Shantanu for reporting this one and Felix Buenemann for
    suggesting the fix.

VERSION 4.0.6: 10/16/2008
  Fixed a problem in examine_ip_in_rdns_keyword_entry() that was not correctly
    terminating the end of the keyword buffer, causing strstr() to search too
    far, leading to false negatives (and potentially segmentation faults).
    Thanks to Erald Troja for reporting this one.
  Fixed another problem in middleman() that was not correctly replacing _all_
    of qmail's AUTH advertisements when the "smtp-auth-level" option is
    "always" or "always-encrypted".  Thanks to Youri Kravatsky for reporting
    this one (again).
  Fixed the fix to a bug in nihdns_query() that was setting
    return_target_name_index to 0 in all cases.  This was causing log messages
    to print the first RBL/RHSBL name instead of the one that actually matched.
    Thanks to Arthur Girardi for reporting this one (again).
  Reverted a change from 4.0.5 -- removing the usable_buf_input flag from
    middleman() meant could only tell if there was input in the buffer, not if
    any of it was actually usable.  If the remote server delays sending its
    data for any reason, middleman() will loop rapidly to continually check if
    its buffered data can be sent to qmail.  Removing the flag meant spamdyke
    was consuming 100% CPU while receiving messages with large attachments.
    Thanks to Paulo Henrique Fonseca for reporting this one.
  Added the "cputime" program to the "tests" folder to measure the CPU time
    used by a process.  Neither the shell "time" command nor the POSIX "time"
    command seem to do that.
  Changed sendrecv to always wait() for its child processes so CPU accounting
    will be performed correctly.
  Fixed check_rhsbl() to correctly return the name of the matching RHSBL instead
    of an index that could be beyond the end of the array.
  Changed the values of LOG_USE_CONFIG_TEST, LOG_USE_STDERR and LOG_USE_SYSLOG
    to make none of them equal to 0.  Because the "log-target" option is a
    CONFIG_TYPE_NAME_MULTIPLE option, it is set to 0 until the command line and
    all configuration files are parsed.  When LOG_USE_CONFIG_TEST is 0, the
    progress messages from process_config_file() are sent to stderr until the
    configuration file is completely loaded.  For Plesk users, xinetd sends
    stderr to the network connection, so the remote server gets the output.
    Thanks to Arthur Girdari for reporting this one and helping track it down.

VERSION 4.0.5: 10/13/2008
VERSION 4.0.5-beta4: 10/8/2008
  Fixed a serious problem in middleman() that was performing pointer arithmetic
    on a NULL pointer when the remote server closed the connection unexpectedly.
    This was causing segmentation faults when attempts were made to read from
    the resulting addresses.  Many, many thanks to David Stiller for reporting
    this one and providing tons of help to nail it down.
VERSION 4.0.5-beta3: 10/6/2008
  Fixed a serious problem in read_file() that was losing the pointer to a
    pre-allocated array, then reallocating the array and assuming the first few
    indexes were still valid.  This was happening when "-entry" and "-file"
    options were being used together and resulting in segmentation faults.
    Many, many thanks to David Stiller for reporting this one and providing
    tons of help to nail it down.
VERSION 4.0.5-beta2: 10/4/2008
  Rewrote the address parser so it will now correctly handle strange/invalid
    addresses like "MAIL FROM:<@>".  Incorrect parsing was causing problems with
    the graylist filter's path creation (among other things).  Thanks to Erald
    Troja for reporting this one.
VERSION 4.0.5-beta1: 9/27/2008
  Fixed a typo in filter_sender_rhsbl() that was printing the wrong verbose log
    message when an RHSBL match was found ("FILTER_SENDER_BLACKLIST" instead of
    "FILTER_RHSBL_MATCH").  Thanks to Arthur Girardi for reporting this one.
  Fixed a bug in nihdns_query() that was setting the return_target_name_index
    variable to values beyond the range of the target_name_array array.  This
    was causing log messages to print garbage and could cause segmentation
    faults.  Thanks to Arthur Girardi for reporting this one.
  Fixed middleman() to use memchr() instead of strchr().  When presented with
    message content that contains null bytes, strchr() won't search beyond them
    and so can't find line terminators.  Of course, email isn't supposed to
    contain unencoded null bytes but apparently not everyone knows that.
    Without line terminators, all connections would hang and eventually time
    out.  Thanks to Arthur Girardi for reporting this one.
  Fixed sendrecv to use memchr() instead of strchr() so tests involving null
    characters will work correctly.  Thanks to Arthur Girardi for reporting
    this one.
  Reordered some of the operations in free_current_options() to explicitly set
    pointers to static buffers when the current_options structure is
    deallocated.
  Fixed a serious ordering problem in smtp_filter() that would close the
    connection to qmail (forcing qmail to quit) after the first bad recipient
    was given, even if a configuration directory was in use.  If the second
    recipient was good, qmail would already be closed and dead.  Thanks to
    David Stiller for reporting this one.
  Removed some unnecessary calls to strlen() in configuration.c in an attempt
    to figure out why spamdyke is (occasionally) crashing as it exits.
  Added a timeout flag to smtpdummy to cause it to quit with a non-zero exit
    code after some number of seconds idle.
  Changed smtpdummy to send some extra greeting banners after EHLO.
  Changed smtpdummy to accept a flag to optionally send an AUTH advertisement
    after EHLO.
  Fixed middleman() to correctly replace any AUTH advertisements when
    "smtp-auth-level" is "always" or "always-encrypted" by including a
    continuation character when appropriate.  Thanks to Youri Kravatsky for
    reporting this one.
  Changed middleman() to check the idle timeout setting when qmail is closed.
    If it is 0 (deactivated), it is set to 1200 (20 minutes).  This is not
    backwards incompatible because qmail uses a 20 minute idle timeout while
    it's running.  Deactivated idle timeouts are causing a lot of problems
    on mail servers when remote clients never disconnect.  Thanks to
    Matthew Kettlewell for reporting this one.

VERSION 4.0.4: 9/5/2008
  Moved the code for loading configuration files into prepare_settings() from
    do_spamdyke().  When the default value for the "log-target" option was
    being set before the configuration files were read, the syslog option
    could be incorrectly set, even if stderr was specified in a file.
    Thanks to Eric Shubert for reporting this one.
  Changed the configure script to detect environments where printf()/scanf()
    use "%ld" for 64-bit integers instead of "%lld" (CentOS 64-bit).  This
    wouldn't be necessary if the gcc authors could grasp the idea that
    "long int" and "long long int" may be interchangable and not emit warnings.
    Thanks to kjl for reporting this one.

VERSION 4.0.3: 8/12/2008
  Changed the configure script to detect environments where printf()/scanf()
    use "%qd" for 64-bit integers instead of "%lld" (FreeBSD).  Thanks to
    Shane Bywater for reporting this one.
  Fixed load_resolver_file() to ignore invalid/unparsable nameserver values
    in /etc/resolv.conf and default to 127.0.0.1 if no valid entries are
    found.  Thanks to slamp slamp for reporting this one.

VERSION 4.0.2: 8/6/2008
  Fixed a bug in filter_graylist() that was creating infinitely deep "_none"
    directories.  The special-case conversion code added in 4.0.1 was not
    checking to see if "_none" was a file or a directory and performing the
    conversion every time.  Thanks to Bob Alanis for reporting this one.

VERSION 4.0.1: 7/17/2008
  Fixed a bug in filter_graylist() that was generating errors trying to convert
    an old-style graylist entry to the new structure.  When the sender address
    is empty, the old entry is named "_none" and the code was trying to move it
    to "_none/_none" which is obviously not possible.  Thanks to David Stiller
    for reporting this one.
  Fixed the grace values in prepare_list() and added a new field to the 
    spamdyke_option structure for running actions after all values have been
    set, whether any flags were set or not.  These changes allow spamdyke to
    reject connections as early as possible, possibly not even starting up
    qmail, depending on the configuration.  Prior to this fix, spamdyke was
    allowing TLS passthrough for connections that should have been blocked
    when STARTTLS was given because no whitelists were given and SMTP AUTH
    was not possible.  Thanks to Sergio Minini for reporting this one.
  Fixed a double-free() error in free_current_options() that was causing
    spamdyke to crash if the "rejection-text-graylist" option was used from
    a configuration directory.  This bug was triggered because the option
    has the alternate "rejection-text-greylist" form that uses the same
    variable.  After the free() was taking place, the variable was not being
    set to NULL, so the second option caused a second free().
  Fixed a compiler warning on Solaris.

VERSION 4.0.0: 7/14/2008
VERSION 4.0.0-rc1: 7/7/2008
  Finished updating the documentation for version 4.0.0.
VERSION 4.0.0-beta3: 7/2/2008
  Fixed a bug in set_config_value() that was returning an error every time a
    string was appended to a string array option that already had at least one
    value.  This was preventing the post-connect filters from working if a
    file in a configuration directory set an additional value on a string array.
  Fixed filter_earlytalker() to prevent spurious error messages when
    greeting-delay-secs is set from a configuration file and a configuration
    directory is also in use.
  Added the options "rejection-text-auth-failure",
    "rejection-text-auth-unknown", "rejection-text-tls-failure" and
    "rejection-text-zero-recipients".
VERSION 4.0.0-beta2: 6/12/2008
  Fixed nihdns_expand() to correctly terminate the expanded strings.
  Fixed filter_sender_no_mx() to not try to check for MX records if the sender
    domain is empty.
  Fixed find_address() to correctly handle empty senders with extra paramters,
    e.g. "MAIL FROM:<> SIZE=1234" should return an empty sender, not
    "SIZE=1234".
  Changed output_writeln() to append the process ID and a random number to the
    end of the full log filename, so several instances of spamdyke started
    within the same second will not try to use the same filename.
  Changed do_spamdyke()'s usage of srandom() to use the current time multiplied
    by the process ID so multiple spamdyke processes started within the same
    second will not use the same random seed.
  Added the option "rejection-text-greylist" as an alias of
    "rejection-text-graylist".
VERSION 4.0.0-beta1: 5/31/2008
  NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE: Added a new log level -- VERBOSE -- and reorganized
    the log message levels a bit.  ERROR now includes only critical errors like
    low memory, network errors (not including protocol errors), filesystem
    permission errors, configuration-related errors and config-test errors.
    INFO is only for traffic logging and config-test success/info messages.
    VERBOSE is for non-critical errors like network errors caused by the remote
    host, SMTP/DNS/SSL protocol errors, child process messages (exit status
    and/or runtime errors) and config-test status messages.  DEBUG is for
    high-level debugging output to show processing sequence.  EXCESSIVE is for
    low-level debugging output to show progress and data.
  Added the "disable-config-test" option to the configure script to allow
    spamdyke to be built without the configuration testing code.  This reduces
    the size of the spamdyke binary by as much as 48KB (19%).  By default, the
    configuration testing code is included.
  Added the "without-debug-output" option to the configure script to allow
    spamdyke to be built without the "debug" output.  This decreases the size of
    the spamdyke binary by as much as 8KB (3%).  By default, the debugging
    output is included.
  Added the "with-excessive-output" option to the configure script to allow
    spamdyke to be built with the "excessive" output.  This increases the size
    of the spamdyke binary by as much as 16KB (6%).  By default, the excessive
    output is not included.
  Changed the version string to show "+CONFIGTEST", "+DEBUG" and "+EXCESSIVE" if
    spamdyke is compiled with the config-test option, debugging output and
    excessive debugging output, respectively.
  Fixed a bug in dns_rbl() that would crash spamdyke if excessive logging was
    enabled and a DNS TXT response was received.
  Changed dns_get() to accept both a list of target addresses and target types,
    then query them all simultaneously.  Since DNS RBL and DNS RHSBL checks
    only need one positive result to finish, this method is much faster than
    querying each name in sequence, especially for sites that use many RBLs
    and/or RHSBLs.
  Renamed all of the dns_* functions to nihdns_* to avoid name collisions with
    the system resolver library.
  Added nihdns_expand() and nihdns_skip() to replace dn_expand() and dn_skip().
  Changed the excessive log statements to print the function name, the file
    and line number when the log message is generated.
  Added the IP address of the remote server to the header of log files generated
    by full logging.
  Changed do_spamdyke() to find the remote server's rDNS name after the command
    line and config file have been processed, so the DNS debugging output can
    be printed into the full log file (if desired).
  NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE: Changed the file naming convention for full log
    files not to include the remote server's rDNS name or the remote server's
    IP address because the log file may be opened before that information is
    available.
  Changed config_test_child_capabilities() to recommend recompiling spamdyke
    with TLS support if appropriate.
  Added "tls-level" option to prevent TLS support or to offer SMTPS.
  Changed output_write_rejection() to conditionally append the policy URL to the
    rejection text based on which message is being printed.  There's no need to
    append the policy URL to an SMTP AUTH success message, for example.
  Changed process_command_line() and config_test() to search for (and set)
    multiple environment variables if the remote server's IP address isn't found
    in TCPREMOTEIP.  Using REMOTE_HOST makes spamdyke compatible with older
    Linux inetd installations.  Thanks to Venkat Iyer for suggesting this one.
  Replaced the T_* DNS type definitions with new values defined in spamdyke.h.
  Defined the nihdns_header structure and the MAX_PACKET_SIZE, NIHDNS_GETINT16
    and NIHDNS_GETINT32 macros to replace values from the resolver header files.
  Created load_resolver_file() to load and parse the system resolver
    configuration file (typically /etc/resolv.conf).
  Changed nihdns_initialize() to call load_resolver_file() instead of
    res_init().
  Added a current_environment to the filter_settings structure to hold the
    current effective environment (as modified by any upstack callers).  This
    allows the envp parameter to be removed from nearly every function
    declaration.  The number of functions expecting the environment pointer
    was getting out of hand.
  Removed the checks for the resolver header files from the configure script,
    as spamdyke no longer needs them.
  Added the option "dns-level" to allow DNS traffic to be turned off entirely,
    set to imitate the standard system resolver library or set to behave more
    aggressively than the standard system resolver.  Thanks to Jake for
    suggesting this one.
  Added the options "dns-server-ip" and "dns-server-ip-primary" so different DNS
    servers can be specified than what the rest of the system uses.
  Added the options "dns-max-retries-total" and "dns-max-retries-primary" to
    control the number of retransmissions made during DNS queries.
  Added the option "dns-timeout-secs" to control how long spamdyke will wait for
    a response to a DNS query.
  Added the option "run-as-user" to change user/group IDs during normal
    operation.  tcpserver already does this but anyone running from a
    "superserver" like inetd can use this to run under a non-root user.  Thanks
    to Allen Clark for suggesting this one.
  NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE: Removed the "config-test-user" option, as it is now
    replaced by "run-as-user".
  Added the option "smtp-auth-level" to control SMTP AUTH behavior.  AUTH can
    now be blocked entirely, observed only, provided only when qmail doesn't
    offer it or always offered/processed by spamdyke.
  NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE: Removed the "smtp-auth-command-encryption" option,
    as it is now replaced by "smtp-auth-level".
  Added the option "filter-level" to allow all connections, reject all
    connections, reject all connections that do not authenticate or select
    normal behavior (configured filters).
  Changed middleman() to create a log entry saying "TLS_ENCRYPTED" when TLS
    data is passed through and spamdyke cannot determine the sender or
    recipient(s).
  Added a template spamdyke.conf file, contributed by Andrew Liles.
  NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE: Changed the graylist system to create a deeper
    directory structure by creating folders for the senders' domain names.  This
    will allow busy servers to use graylisting even when the number of sender
    addresses could exceed the number of entries allowed in a folder.  Thanks
    to Trog for suggesting this one.
  Added some code to automatically move old-style graylist entries into the new
    structure as they are accessed.  This will make upgrading to 4.0 simpler
    but there is no code to gracefully revert to the old style if the spamdyke
    version is downgraded.
  Added a new function named read_file() to read an arbitrary range of lines
    from a file into an array of strings.
  Renamed the function formerly known as read_file() to read_file_first_line()
    and refactored it to call read_file() internally.
  Changed config_test_graylist() to load the contents of the local domains files
    (if given) and compare the local domains to the list of domain directories
    within the graylist folder.  If extra directories are found, errors are
    printed.  If local domains exist that do not have domain directories, errors
    are printed.
  Changed output_writeln() to print a timestamp line into the log every time it
    is called, even if the previous call sent data the same way.  This makes it
    much easier to see how much data is being sent in each write().
  Changed middleman() to send message data to qmail in large bursts instead of
    line-by-line like the rest of the SMTP traffic.  For remote servers that
    send their message data in large packets, this will be a big performance
    boost.
  Changed middleman() to use 16K buffers instead of 4K buffers so more message
    data can be processed with fewer read()/write() calls (if the remote server
    sends the message data in bursts).
  Changed the MAX_BUF definition to 1023 instead of 4095.  Lots of stack
    variables are declared using MAX_BUF as a length and 4K was not needed.
    1K will save stack space and reduce spamdyke's memory footprint.
  Changed dnsa, dnsany, dnsany_libc, dnscname, dnsmx, dnsns, dnsptr, dnssoa and
    dnstxt to once again chase CNAMEs, effectively undoing the changes from
    version 3.1.0.
  Changed the warning messages when TLS support is not compiled/configured to
    list the filters that cannot function.
  Moved the filter code out of run_tests() and into separate functions for each
    filter to make them easier to call individually.  The new functions are in
    filter.c.
  Moved the calls to the filter functions into do_spamdyke() and removed
    run_tests().
  Moved search_ip() and is_ip_in_name() into filter.c.
  Moved the logic in check_rdns_resolve(), check_country_code(),
    check_rdns_keywords() and check_earlytalker() into filter_rdns_resolve(),
    filter_ip_in_rdns_cc(), filter_ip_in_rdns() and filter_earlytalker(),
    respectively.  Those functions were only being called from one place anyway,
    so having the separate functions didn't seem to make much sense.
  Moved check_rbl() and check_rhsbl() into filter.c.
  Moved the logic for sender whitelist files, sender RHSWLs, sender blacklist
    files, sender RHSBLs, required SMTP AUTH and missing sender MX records from
    smtp_filter() into filter_sender_whitelist(), filter_sender_rhswl(),
    filter_sender_blacklist(), filter_sender_rhsbl(), filter_smtp_auth() and
    filter_sender_no_mx(), respectively.
  Moved the logic for recipient whitelist files, unqualified recipients,
    relaying, maximum recipients, recipient blacklist files and graylisting
    into filter_recipient_whitelist(), filter_recipient_local(),
    filter_recipient_relay(), filter_recipient_max(),
    filter_recipient_blacklist() and filter_recipient_graylist(), respectively.
  Fixed the configure script to look for libgnugetopt.  This will allow spamdyke
    to compile on older versions of Solaris where libc does not include
    getopt_long().  Thanks to Davide Bozzelli for reporting and helping me fix
    this one.
  Refactored tls_error() to construct the error message in a static buffer and
    return a pointer to that buffer.  This way, the caller can decide what log
    level to use for the message instead of logging all TLS messages as ERROR.
  Changed search_domain_directory() to return the path to the matching file when
    successful and NULL when unsuccessful.
  Fixed do_spamdyke() to replace the TCPLOCALPORT environment variable with a
    value of 25 and to remove the SMTPS environment variable, if present.  Some
    patched qmail installations (e.g. Plesk) use the TCPLOCALPORT value to
    determine whether to start their own SMTPS and tunnelling an SSL session
    within an SSL session doesn't work well.  Thanks to Otto Berger for
    reporting this one.  Also, some other qmail-related programs (notably
    vpopmail's vckpw) alter their behavior when TCPLOCALPORT is not 25.
  Added log messages to every filter routine to make it clear when (and why) a
    filter is triggered.  This should help troubleshooting.  Thanks to Frederic
    Nouvian for suggesting this one.
  Audited all heap usage to ensure all allocated memory is being correctly
    deallocated.  spamdyke is a short-lived process so memory leaks aren't
    really a concern at the moment but someday that may change.  In any case,
    proper memory management is never a bad thing.
  NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE: Changed the default value of "idle-timeout-secs"
    to 0 (disabled) instead of 60.  This was causing problems in production with
    slow/misbehaving clients.
  Changed middleman() to simply close the connection to qmail when an error
    occurs instead of sending <CRLF>.<CRLF>QUIT<CRLF> first.  Closing the
    connection prevents qmail from sending partially-completed messages.  This
    was causing problems with slow clients that were being disconnected for
    timeouts.  When the client retried, the users were getting multiple copies
    of incomplete messages.  Thanks to Chris Robinson for pointing this out.
  Changed output_write_rejection() to append the rejection code to the policy
    URL, if one was provided.  Thanks to Faris Raouf for suggesting this one.
  Moved all of the variables that can be set by configuration options into a
    new structure named option_set.
  Moved output_writeln() from spamdyke.c to log.c.
  Changed spamdyke_log() to call output_writeln() so all log messages will also
    be printed to the full log file, if one exists.  This includes log messages
    below the current log level, as long as they were compiled in.
  Added print_configuration() to print the current configuration into the full
    log file, wherever it differs from the defaults.
  Changed spamdyke_log() to use more descriptive labels instead of "<<<", ">>>",
    "<XX", etc.
  Changed all instances where fprintf() outputs to a file to catch and log
    errors.  This should help spamdyke behave more politely when something goes
    wrong with the filesystem (e.g. out of space).
  NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE: Changed integer options that required specific
    values to take strings instead.  "log-target" now takes "stderr" and
    "syslog" instead of 0 and 1.  "log-level" now takes "none", "error", "info",
    "verbose", "debug" and "excessive" instead of 0-5.  Integer values for these
    options are no longer accepted.
  Changed set_config_value() to process string values for integer options.
  Changed usage() to print the valid string values for integer options.
  Changed the "log-target" option to accept multiple values for anyone who wants
    to log to both syslog and stderr.  Thanks to Davide Bozzelli for suggesting
    this one.
  Added the option "config-dir" to specify a directory to search for
    configuration files.  The required structure is bit complex but it should
    allow for incredible flexibility when configuring spamdyke for specific
    situations.
  Added the option "config-dir-search" to specify how the configuration
    directory(ies) should be searched.
  Changed process_config_file() to only print errors when it encounters illegal
    or unparsable options in configuration files in a configuration directory
    (as opposed to printing the usage header and exiting).
  Changed do_spamdyke() and middleman() to delay calling the filter functions
    until after "RCPT TO" is given, if a configuration directory is specified.
  Changed prepare_settings() to allow some options to be used within files in
    a configuration directory.
  NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE: Changed set_config_value() to handle two special
    values: a value starting with "!" will unset that value, if it was
    previously set.  A value of "!!!" will unset all values for that option.
    This usage is only valid for string and named integer options.
  NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE: Renamed the "check-dnsrbl" option to
    "dns-blacklist-entry", renamed the "check-rhsbl" option to
    "rhs-blacklist-entry", renamed the "check-dns-whitelist" option to
    "dns-whitelist-entry", renamed the "check-rhs-whitelist" option to
    "rhs-whitelist-entry" and renamed the "ip-in-rdns-keyword-file" option to
    "ip-in-rdns-keyword-blacklist-file".
  Added the options "dns-blacklist-file", "dns-whitelist-file",
    "rhs-blacklist-file" and "rhs-whitelist-file" to load the names of DNS RBLs,
    DNS RWLs, DNS RHSBLs and DNS RHSWLs to be loaded from files, respectively.
  Added the option "ip-in-rdns-keyword-whitelist-file" to whitelist connections
    from remote servers whose rDNS names contain a keyword and the IP address.
    Thanks to Andreas Galatis for suggesting this one.
  Added the option "graylist-level" to set the behavior of the graylist filter.
    The two options "always-create-dir" and "only-create-dir" will create domain
    folders automatically if needed, eliminating the need to create the folders
    manually when the domain is added to the server.  However, those two options
    will not create folders for non-local domains (requiring the use of
    "local-domains-file").
  NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE: Changed "graylist-dir" to require the use of
    "graylist-level" before it will have any effect.
  NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE: Removed the "no-graylist-dir" option.  Its
    functionality is now part of "graylist-level".
  NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE: Removed the "always-graylist-ip-file" and
    "never-graylist-ip-file" options and moved their functionality to a new
    option named "graylist-exception-ip-file".
  NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE: Removed the "always-graylist-rdns-file" and
    "never-graylist-rdns-file" options and moved their functionality to a new
    option named "graylist-exception-rdns-file".
  NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE: Removed the "always-graylist-rdns-dir" and
    "never-graylist-rdns-dir" options and moved their functionality to a new
    option named "graylist-exception-rdns-dir".
  Added a test to config_test() to check if the option_list array is
    alphabetized correctly.
  Added a test to prepare_settings() to check if the short codes in the
    option_list array are being mistakenly reused.
  Changed set_config_value() to enforce maximum string lengths (if appropriate).
  Changed set_config_value() to read integer values into a long integer so
    values greater than INT32_MAX can be caught and reported.
  NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE: Set the maximum length of the "policy-url" option
    to 100 characters.  The documentation had always stated this was the limit
    but it was not being enforced in the code.
  Added the options "rejection-text-access-denied",
    "rejection-text-dns-blacklist", "rejection-text-earlytalker",
    "rejection-text-empty-rdns", "rejection-text-graylist",
    "rejection-text-ip-blacklist", "rejection-text-ip-in-cc-rdns",
    "rejection-text-ip-in-rdns-keyword-blacklist",
    "rejection-text-local-recipient", "rejection-text-max-recipients",
    "rejection-text-missing-sender-mx", "rejection-text-other",
    "rejection-text-rdns-blacklist", "rejection-text-recipient-blacklist",
    "rejection-text-relaying-denied", "rejection-text-rhs-blacklist",
    "rejection-text-sender-blacklist", "rejection-text-smtp-auth-required",
    "rejection-text-timeout", "rejection-text-unresolvable-rdns" and
    "rejection-text-reject-all" to allow the default rejection text to be
    customized without editing the source code.  Thanks to Greg Cirino for
    suggesting this one.
  Moved the matching logic from search_file() into examine_entry() so it can be
    called externally for a single string.
  Moved the matching logic from search_tcprules_file() into
    examine_tcprules_entry() so it can be called externally for a single string.
  Added the options "graylist-exception-ip-entry",
    "graylist-exception-rdns-entry", "ip-blacklist-entry", "ip-whitelist-entry",
    "local-domain-entry", "rdns-blacklist-entry", "rdns-whitelist-entry",
    "recipient-blacklist-entry", "recipient-whitelist-entry",
    "sender-blacklist-entry", "sender-whitelist-entry",
    "ip-in-rdns-keyword-blacklist-entry" and
    "ip-in-rdns-keyword-whitelist-entry" to allow single entries to be
    provided from the configuration file that would otherwise need to be read
    from files (using corresponding "-file" options).
  Fixed usage() so error messages from bad configuration options are sent to
    stderr (and therefore logged by tcpserver) instead of being sent to stdout
    (and therefore sent to the remote server).  Thanks to Jacob Billingsley for
    reporting this one.
  Changed config_test() to count the number of values given each "-entry" option
    and recommend moving those values to a file if there are too many.
  Changed the CONFIG_TYPE of the "-file" options that have corresponding "-dir"
    options.
  Changed config_test_file_read() and config_test_file_read_write() to count the
    number of lines in readable files and print errors if the files are too long
    and some content will be ignored.  If the number of lines are more than the
    recommended length, a warning will be printed.
  Changed the Makefile so "make install" will copy the spamdyke binary to
    /usr/local/bin/spamdyke-x.y.z and create a soft link named
    /usr/local/bin/spamdyke.  This makes it easier to roll back to a previous
    version.  Thanks to Andreas Galatis for suggesting this one.
  Moved the TODO list from the top of this file into a new file named TODO.txt.
  Fixed a small bug in spamdyke's configure script that assumed the script was
    being run under the bash shell.  Thanks to Amitai Schlair for reporting this
    one.
  Refactored the test scripts so the tests for root permissions, environment
    variables and compiled options are now in the "run" script instead of in
    each script that needs the features.  The duplicated code had become
    inconvenient to maintain.
  Added a README.txt file to the "tests" folder to describe the test scripts,
    because some people seem to think they can help diagnose configuration
    problems (they can't).
  Fixed compiler warnings in dns.c on Ubuntu 6.  Thanks to Diederik Kohnhorst
    for reporting this one.
  Added three new formats to the "IP in rDNS" filters.  If the IP address is
    11.22.33.44, spamdyke now searches for 11.022.033.044, 11.22.033.044 and
    11.22.33.044.  Thanks to Pavel V. Yanchenko for suggesting this one.
  Fixed smtp_filter() so a whitelisted recipient doesn't whitelist the entire
    message, including blacklisted recipients.  Thanks to Venkat Iyer for
    reporting this one.
  Changed the sender whitelist and blacklist filters to allow the files/entries
    to use "@" as a wildcard at the end of the entry, not just the start.
  Changed stderr logging to print "spamdyke" and the process ID at the start of
    the line, to make it easier to find spamdyke's messages when using multilog.
    Thanks to Eric Shubert for suggesting this one.
  Fixed the help text for the "max-recipients" option to state that a value of
    0 disables the feature.  Thanks to Marcin Orlowski for reporting this one.
  Added two new formats to the "IP in rDNS" filters.  If the IP address is
    11.22.33.44, spamdyke now searches for 11.22.3344 and 11.223344.  Thanks
    to Arne Metzger for suggesting this one.
  Added a new option, "relay-level", to allow spamdyke's relaying filter to be
    explicitly controlled.  This flag can be used to block all connections, to
    prevent relay checking, to do normal relay checking or to allow all
    connections (create an open relay).
  Changed the option_list in prepare_settings() so the "config-file" option
    does not call process_config_file() as it is processed.  Instead, it saves
    the configuration file names in an array.  They are processed later, in
    do_spamdyke(), after the entire command line has been processed and the
    user ID has been switched.  Without this, configuration files were always
    loaded using the credentials spamdyke starts with.
  NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE: Changed "max-recipients" to be enforced for all
    connections, even local senders.  Bypassing the filter requires
    authentication or whitelisting.
  Added an index variable to the rejection_data structure to track which
    rejection was used as a template for the currently assigned rejection.  This
    is necessary because the messages can now be customized.
  Updated the configure.ac script to check for stdint.h, inttypes.h, time.h,
    sys/time.h, uint16_t, uint32_t, uint64_t and INADDR_LOOPBACK.  The logging
    macros now declare their variable arguments using the old-style GCC notation
    instead of the C99 style.  These changes allow spamdyke to compile on truly
    ancient Unixes like FreeBSD 2.2.2 (released sometime between 1/1995 and
    11/1998).  Thanks to VJ for reporting this one.
  Added find_case_insensitive_needle() to convert the needle to lowercase and
    run strstr().  This was necessary because (apparently) strcasestr() is not
    available everywhere.
  Added print_current_environment() to print the current environment variables
    into the log file (if one exists).
  Changed do_spamdyke() to print the remote server's IP address into the log
    file after it has been found.

VERSION 3.1.8 -- 5/21/2008
  Fixed smtp_filter() to reject the DATA command if no valid recipients have
    been specified.  Otherwise, a specific scenario could result in every
    spamdyke installation being used as an open relay.  If the remote server
    connects and gives one or more recipients that are rejected (for relaying or
    blacklisting), then gives the DATA command, spamdyke will ignore all other
    commands, assuming that message data is being transmitted.  However, because
    all of the recipients were rejected, qmail will reject the DATA command.
    From that point on, the remote server can give as many recipients as it
    likes and spamdyke will ignore them all -- they will not be filtered at all.
    After that, the remote server can give the DATA command and send the actual
    message data.  Because spamdyke is controlling relaying, the RELAYCLIENT
    environment variable is set and qmail won't check for relaying either.
    Thanks to Mirko Buffoni for reporting this one.
  Fixed compiling with gcc 3.4.6 (on old Gentoo installations), which requires
    a "-Wp,-Wno-trampolines" flag to suppress a warning about trampoline
    functions.  Thanks to Thorsten Puzich for reporting and helping me fix this
    one.
  Fixed compiling on CentOS 3.8, which installs the krb5.h in
    /usr/kerberos/include instead of /usr/include.  Thanks to Bruce Schreiber
    for reporting this one.
  Changed middleman() to reset the idle timeout timer while waiting for qmail's
    responses.  It's not fair to disconnect a remote server because qmail is
    running slow.  The connection timeout timer is always enforced, however.
  Fixed a bug in middleman() to reset the idle timeout timer every time data is
    read from the remote server.  Previously, the timer was only reset when data
    was read and the buffer was empty.  This was causing large messages from
    fast remote servers to timeout during delivery.  Thanks to Eric Shubert for
    reporting and helping me fix this one.

VERSION 3.1.7 -- 4/6/2008
  Fixed search_file() so a wildcard doesn't match every character, only ones
    from a fixed set.  This prevents the entry "@example.com" from matching
    "foo@notexample.com".  Thanks to Tom for reporting this one.

VERSION 3.1.6 -- 2/10/2008
  Fixed a serious bug in middleman() -- when the remote server sent its message
    data and QUIT command in a burst and disconnected before spamdyke read() all
    of the data, the last data returned from read() was printed twice.  This
    could cause message corruption, especially in the case of attachments.
  Fixed a serious bug in middleman() -- when the remote server sent its data
    in bursts of 4096 bytes AND there were two lines of text in the data
    AND the 4096th character was not a newline AND there was a delay between the
    data bursts, memmove()ing the buffered data was causing corruption because
    the moved data was not being properly re-terminated.  While processing the
    remaining buffered data (and waiting for another burst from the remote
    server), strchr() would seek past the end of the data to an old newline
    character and middleman() would erroneously conclude the next line of data
    was complete, ready for processing.  Many thanks to Andreas Galatis and
    Dragomir Denev for reporting and helping me reproduce this one.
  Added a -W flag to sendrecv to introduce a delay between message data bursts.
  Added a -o flag to smtpdummy to save the message data to a file.

VERSION 3.1.5 -- 1/22/2008
  Fixed sendrecv to correctly process corrupted TLS negotiations instead of
    covering up bugs in spamdyke.
  Fixed spamdyke to not add garbage output at the beginning of TLS passthrough
    negotiations.  This was causing SSL handshakes to fail.  Thanks to Ronnie
    Tartar for reporting this one.

VERSION 3.1.4 -- 1/21/2008
  Fixed all of the Makefiles to remove a symbols directory Leopard's gcc seems
    to create when compiling in debug mode.
  Fixed middleman() to log the timeout message only once.
  Fixed middleman() to not expect input from the child process when the child
    process' input is being ignored or after the child process has exited.
  Fixed middleman() to correctly handle a rare situation -- when the child
    process was too slow responding that spamdyke's idle timeout was passed
    AND spamdyke was processing TLS data AND there was still data in the SSL
    buffer, spamdyke would loop infinitely, consuming 100% CPU.  This was a
    very tricky bug to find and fix.  Thanks to Pablo Gonzalez and Paolo for
    reporting this one and helping me debug it.
  Fixed middleman() to send message data to the child process line-by-line,
    even when the buffer is full.
  Added a new test program: smtpdummy.  This one simulates an SMTP server and
    can add delays after specific commands.
  Changed sendrecv to use a 64K buffer for input and output data.
  Changed sendrecv to kill the its child process after its timeout expires.
  Changed sendrecv to optionally continue sending data in bursts after the end
    for the message data.  Some mail servers do this.
  Changed sendrecv to deliberately send corrupt data while TLS is active.
  Changed test regression_009 to build its message payload at runtime instead
    of including a 0.75M file.  This file was unnecesarily increasing the size
    of the spamdyke tarball.
  Fixed compiling on Solaris.  Again.  Thanks to Davide Bozzelli for reporting
    this.  Again.  Sigh.

VERSION 3.1.3 -- 1/3/2008
  Fixed the format string LOG_INFO_DNS_TXT to assign the parameters correctly
  and prevent bus errors when the DNS response text is long.

VERSION 3.1.2 -- 12/11/2007
  Fixed smtp_filter() to set a flag after some SMTP commands to force
    middleman() to wait for input from the child process before proceeding.
    Some (nonspammer) mail servers send their data in bursts without waiting for
    responses.  This was causing spamdyke to skip logging (but not filtering)
    if the DATA command was sent in a burst with RCPT TO.  Thanks to Sebastien
    Guilbaud and Bucky Carr for reporting this one.
  Added a "-b" flag to sendrecv to simulate servers that send their message data
    (but not their SMTP commands) in bursts.

VERSION 3.1.1 -- 11/12/2007
  Added excessive logging to search_domain_directory() to log the directory
    search pattern.
  Changed all calls to spamdyke_log() to use the macros SPAMDYKE_LOG_NONE(),
    SPAMDYKE_LOG_ERROR(), SPAMDYKE_LOG_INFO(), SPAMDYKE_LOG_DEBUG() and
    SPAMDYKE_LOG_EXCESSIVE() instead.  The macro tests the current log level
    without forcing a function call and also paves the way toward eliminating
    some logging code at compile-time.
  Fixed process_access() to correctly search for the RELAYCLIENT variable in
    spamdyke's environment.  Thanks to Steve Cole for reporting this one.

VERSION 3.1.0 -- 11/5/2007
  Changed the "graylist-dir" and "no-graylist-dir" options to take multiple
    directories for servers that are hosting so many domains that they can't
    create enough domain folders in one place (wow).
  Added minimum and maximum values to all integer options and changed
    set_config_value() to generate error messages when values are out of range.
  Change usage() to print minimum and maximum integer values.
  Alphabetized the option list by long option name and changed
    process_config_file() to use a binary search algorithm when identifying
    directives, a theoretical improvement from O(n/2) to O(log n).
  Changed prepare_settings() to create an array of options indexed by the short
    option code.  This introduces some constant-time work (O(1)) and greater
    memory usage.
  Changed process_command_line() to use the indexed array of options,
    theoretically reducing command line parsing work from O(n/2) to O(1).
    This is a win if the command line has many parameters or if it has
    parameters that are near the end of the unindexed option array.
    Testing confirms a small performance gain.
  Added command line options "config-test-smtpauth-username" and
    "config-test-smtpauth-password".
  Changed config_test_smtpauth() to run the authentication command(s) if a
    username and password are provided.  This incorporates the functionality of
    checkpassword into spamdyke.
  Added the command line option "config-test-user" to change user and group IDs
    before running the configuration tests.  This makes it easier to simulate
    running as the mail server.
  Changed process_config_file() and process_command_line() to print errors and
    stop when they encounter an option that is not legal in that location.  At
    the moment, "help", "version", "config-test",
    "config-test-smtpauth-username", "config-test-smtpauth-password" and
    "config-test-user" are not valid in files; all options are valid on the
    command line.
  Changed config_test_dir_read() and config_test_graylist() to never examine the
    "." or ".." folders, even if readdir() and/or stat() report they are not
    folders.  Thanks to Paulo Henrique for reporting this one.
  Changed set_config_value() to remove trailing slashes from directory paths.
  Added test_spamdyke_binary() to check if the spamdyke binary is setuid root
    (it should not be).
  Renamed test_settings() to config_test().
  Moved all of the configuration test functions to config_test.[ch] -- they were
    cluttering up configuration.c.
  Made a few small updates to the help message text.
  Added additional vchkpw exit codes to exec_checkpassword() to explain why
    vchkpw exited, since it doesn't follow DJB's published checkpassword API.
  Moved md5.[ch] from the "utils" folder to the "spamdyke" folder and updated
    Makefile to compile them into spamdyke.
  Removed passwordcheck from the "utils" folder since spamdyke now contains its
    functionality.
  Added a README file to the "utils" folder to answer the biggest FAQ about
    those utilities.
  Fixed exec_command() to connect the output pipe to the child process's stdin
    instead of file descriptor 3.  The bug was due to copying
    exec_checkpassword() and forgetting to change the value.
  Renamed exec_checkpassword() to exec_checkpassword_argv() and changed its
    arguments to expect a filename and an argument array.
  Added exec_checkpassword() to parse a command string into an argument array
    and call exec_checkpassword_argv().
  Renamed exec_command() to exec_command_argv() and changed its
    arguments to expect a filename and an argument array.
  Added exec_command() to parse a command string into an argument array
    and call exec_command_argv().
  Fixed numerous bugs in exec_command_argv() that were preventing it from
    actually gathering any input from the child process.
  Changed exec_command_argv() and exec_checkpassword_argv() to always log their
    child process errors to syslog, regardless of the user's preferences.
    Otherwise, the errors will be lost.
  Added the function find_path() to search the PATH for the given command
    without executing it.
  Changed exec_command_argv() and exec_checkpassword_argv() to use find_path()
    to locate the executable before fork()ing to catch typos.  The child
    processes then use execve() to execute the command instead of exec_path().
    Otherwise, the parent has a hard time determining that the child process
    quit because the command path was invalid.
  Changed exec_command_argv() and exec_checkpassword_argv() not to wait
    indefinitely for the child to exit after the timeout expires.
  Changed dns_txt(), dns_ptr_lookup() and dns_mx() to limit the total number of
    queries they will recursively perform.  This is to prevent a DoS situation
    where some domain has an unreasonable number of chained (non-circular) CNAME
    records.  The limit is (arbitrarily) set at 16.
  Added the function config_test_child_capabilities() to test the qmail binary
    for SMTP AUTH and TLS patches.  Depending on what is found, recommendations
    for spamdyke flags are made.
  Changed check_rdns_keywords() to allow top-level domains (like .com) to be
    used as keywords.  This allows a way to reject connections from remote
    servers with rDNS names that contain the IP address and a two-letter country
    code.  Unlike check_country_code(), specific country codes can now be
    chosen.
  Fixed do_spamdyke() not to wait indefinitely for all child processes to exit.
    This behavior was causing problems with DJB's recordio because recordio
    fork()s and uses its parent process to exec() spamdyke.  This is very
    unusual.  Changing wait(NULL) to waitpid() fixes the problem.  Thanks to
    Bob Hutchinson for reporting this one.
  Added dns_initialize() and dns_get() to perform DNS queries by sending UDP
    packets instead of using the resolver library to do it.  The resolver
    functions are just too slow and they try to do too much unnecessary work.
    dns_get() performs multiple requests for records (one for each kind of
    desired record) and, if no responses are received, sends requests to the
    secondary nameservers as well.  Timeouts and retransmission times can now
    be controlled.  This has resulted in a significant speedup in DNS
    resolutions; testing shows as much as a 10x performance increase in some
    situations.
  Changed dns_txt(), dns_ptr_lookup() and dns_mx() to search all of the answers
    for the desired answer type before recursively querying CNAME answers.  Some
    nameservers always put the CNAME answers first, even if other answer types
    are also given.  This should allow spamdyke to find answers faster when
    domain admins have used a lot of CNAMEs.
  Added dns_a() to perform A record queries and changed all uses of
    gethostbyname() to use dns_a() instead.
  Changed dnsa, dnsmx, dnsns, dnsptr, dnssoa and dnstxt in the "utils" folder to
    only perform their specific queries, not ask for CNAME records as well.
  Changed dnsa, dnsmx, dnsns, dnsptr, dnssoa and dnstxt in the "utils" folder to
    send their own UDP packets instead of using the resolver library.
  Added dnscname to the "utils" folder to perform CNAME queries.
  Added dnsany to the "utils" folder to perform ANY queries and perform
    recursive CNAME lookups.
  Added "log-target" option to allow logging to stderr instead of syslog.  Some
    people apparently like using the qmail-style "multilog" instead of syslog.
    I can't understand why but I'm here to serve.  Thanks to John Hallam for
    suggesting this one.
  Changed all of the error messages about unexpected file types to specify what
    file type was found -- "non-regular file" was too vague to be useful.
  Changed the header in the files created by full logging to include the
    spamdyke version.
  Changed tls_end_inner() to use SSL_get_shutdown() to see if a shutdown signal
    has already been received.  If SSL_shutdown() is used on a closed file
    descriptor, spamdyke will crash with SIGPIPE.
  Changed all instances of read(), write(), SSL_read() and SSL_write() to read
    or write as many bytes as possible in each call.  This should provide a
    significant performance increase.  The single-byte read()s and write()s
    were only used because I had badly misunderstood the relationship between
    select() and read()/write() -- blocking only occurs when select() indicates
    a file descriptor is not ready.  If it is ready, read() and write() will
    handle as many bytes as they can without blocking.  Thanks to Trog for
    setting me straight on this one.
  Rewrote most of sendrecv in the "tests" folder to use a multi-byte read().
    Also took the opportunity to make sendrecv much faster and more polite, so
    it doesn't consume 100% CPU while waiting for qmail output.
  Fixed compiling errors on 64 bit Linux systems (Debian Etch x86_64 and Gentoo
    AMD64).  Thanks to Juha-Pekka Jarvenpaa and FireBall for reporting this.
  Added config_test_file_type() to use stat() to find a file's type if readdir()
    either doesn't report it (Solaris) or reports "unknown" for all files (XFS).
    Thanks to Paulo Henrique for reporting this one.
  Fixed compiling errors on Solaris.  Thanks to Limperis Antonis for reporting
    this.
  Changed the logging severity of the "unable to write X bytes to file
    descriptor" to debug instead of error.  99% of the time, the error occurs
    because the remote client disconnected unexpectedly and there's nothing
    the administrator can do about it anyway.
  Changed do_spamdyke() to ignore SIGPIPE signals.
  Changed do_spamdyke(), exec_command_argv() and exec_command_checkpassword()
    to change the SIGPIPE signal handler back to default for child processes
    after fork()ing but before exec()ing.
  Added a new logging level: excessive (4).  It's to be used for printing very
    detailed debugging statements.
  Changed process_access() to permit access when no matching lines are found in
    the access file.  Although DJB's tcprules documentation doesn't explicitly
    say so, no matching lines should allow access.  Thanks to Steve Cole for
    reporting this one.

VERSION 3.0.1 -- 9/12/2007
  Fixed "configure" to remove the "_beta1" tag from the version number.  That
    should never have been published.
  Changed usage() to show that optional values to long commands must be
    separated by an equals sign.  getopt_long() is really becoming a hassle.
    Thanks to Richard Kreider for reporting this one.
  Fixed find_address() to accept addresses that aren't correctly delimited with
    <> characters and/or have multiple (illegal) spaces after the colon.  Thanks
    to Davide Bozzelli for reporting this one.
  Fixed prepare_settings() to set the idle timeout seconds to the correct
    variable instead of setting the connection timeout variable.  Thanks to
    Carlo Blohm for reporting this one.
  Fixed smtp_filter() to print the rejection message to HELO and EHLO, even if
    those commands appear in an improper place in the protocol.
  Fixed smtp_filter() to print the rejection message with an error code in
    response to STARTTLS if the command is given in an improper place in the
    protocol.
  Added some regression tests to find these bugs in the future.
  Fixed the usage statement in sendrecv to show the -w flag.

VERSION 3.0.0 -- 9/11/2007
  Added command line options never-graylist-rdns-dir, always-graylist-rdns-dir
    and rdns-whitelist-dir to search domain directory structures just like
    rdns-blacklist-dir.
  Added the command line option rdns-blacklist-file to search a file just like
    rdns-whitelist-file.
  Moved the command line option labels into configuration.c so they can be
    shared with the config file parser.
  Changed process_command_line() to build the list of short options from the
    list of long options instead of hardcoding them.  Less maintenance this way.
  Modified check_rdns_keywords(), search_file() and search_tcprules_file() to
    correctly track line numbers and return the matching line number instead of
    just 1.
  Changed logging to allow the amount of information to be turned up or down.
    This should make spamdyke less chatty in the syslog for small errors.
  Modified smtp_filter() and run_tests() to report the matching filename and
    line number from check_rdns_keywords(), search_file() and
    search_tcprules_file() in syslog if the logging level is high enough.
  Fixed find_address() to locate the real email address and ignore BATV tags,
    relay paths and bang paths.  Thanks to Walter Russo for reporting this one
    (again).
  Changed middleman() to obey minimums and maximums for the amount of time to
    select() for traffic.  If spamdyke waits too long, the qmail process might
    not get wait()ed for a while, leaving a lot of defunct/zombie processes
    around.  On a busy server, this could be a problem.  Thanks to Jason M for
    reporting this one.
  Added process_config_file() to process configuration files instead of
    requiring all configuration to be done on the command line.  At the moment,
    the file just uses the same (long option) directives as the command line.
  Added test_settings() to run tests on every configuration option and
    (hopefully) identify misconfigurations before someone makes them on a live
    server.
  Added the command line option "config-test" to run test_settings().
  Renamed log_writeln() and log_write_rejection() to output_writeln() and
    output_write_rejection(), respectively, to make it clearer what they're
    doing.
  Changed smtp_filter() to allow multiple authentication attempts.  Some
    clients retry authentication several times, presumably to deal with servers
    that can't use the authentication method they prefer.
  Changed middleman() to collect (and send) whole lines of input instead of
    single characters.  Single character write()s were causing problems with
    Nagios and Windows clients.
  Changed output_write_rejection() to create a single output line and send it
    to output_writeln() all at once instead of sending a piece at a time.  This
    keeps packets together for stupid Windows clients that just can't handle
    reassembling TCP packets correctly.
  Changed main() to always run spamdyke (as opposed to starting qmail without
    spamdyke listening) even if a whitelist is matched.  This way, spamdyke
    can report all traffic to syslog, not just traffic that _may_ be filtered.
  Changed smtp_filter() and middleman() to catch the return codes from qmail
    when the remote client gives the recipient address.  Now, if spamdyke
    doesn't block the recipient command but qmail does (e.g. for relaying),
    spamdyke will log the correct message.
  Incorporated GNU autoconf to create a "configure" script for spamdyke and the
    "utils" folder.  The days of "make no_tls" and "make bsd" are thankfully
    over.
  Renamed all of the test folders to group them by function so it's easier to
    see what tests exist.  Sequential numbers just weren't working.
  Changed dns_mx() to lookup the MX record before returning success.  This means
    the sender MX filter now requires a mail exchanger record _and_ at least one
    mail exchanger must have an IP address.  Before, the MX record was enough,
    even if there was no corresponding A record.
  Changed usage() to read the options and help text from get_spamdyke_options()
    in configuration.c so the help message won't ever be out of sync with the
    available options again.
  Added the command line option "tls-privatekey-password-file" to allow the SSL
    private key password to be read from a file instead of the command line.
    This way, the password isn't visible to everyone who can view a process
    list.
  Changed search_file(), search_tcprules_file() and check_rdns_keywords() so
    they no longer build their fscanf() patterns into a stack variable but
    instead use a literal search pattern assembled at compile time with
    STRINGIFY().
  Added the command line options "hostname-file" and "hostname-command" to
    support reading the local hostname from a file or from a command (e.g.
    "hostname -f") instead of forcing it to be specified on the command line.
  Changed middleman() and smtp_filter() to always monitor and trust
    authentication carried out by qmail, even if "smtp-auth-command" was not
    given.  This means spamdyke will always disable its filters for
    authenticated users even if it can't check the authentication itself.
    I'm not sure why I didn't design spamdyke this way in the first place.
  Added command line options recipient-whitelist-file and sender-whitelist-file
    so specific sender and recipient addresses can bypass the filters.  Sender
    addresses are very easy to fake and recipient addresses are, of course,
    known to spammers, so both of these options are ill-advised.  I've only
    added them due to popular demand.
  Added command line option check-rhsbl to check righthand-side blacklists.
    Both the server's rDNS domain name and the sender's email domain name are
    checked.
  Added command line options check-dns-whitelist and check-rhs-whitelist to
    allow DNS RBLs and RHSBLs to act as whitelists instead of blacklists.
    Anyone using DNS-based blacklists _and_ whitelists had better have some
    seriously fast DNS servers.
  Changed dns_txt(), dns_mx() and dns_ptr_lookup() to pass a stack of previous
    queries whenever they recursively lookup CNAME records, to prevent a cylical
    CNAME structure from leading to infinite recursion.
  NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE: Changed the syslog entry format: renamed "origin" to
    "origin_ip", added "origin_rdns:" before the rDNS name, added "auth:"
    before the authenticated username and added "reason:" before the rejection
    reason when a timeout occurs.
  Changed process_command_line() to assume the remote IP address is 0.0.0.0 if
    the environment variable TCPREMOTEIP is not set.
  Added a ton more test scripts for all of the new options and for testing
    config files.
  Added dnsa, dnsns and dnssoa to the "utils" folder for performing DNS queries
    of A, NS and SOA records, respectively.  Wouldn't it be AMAZING if the
    libc maintainers added standard functions to do these queries?!
  NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE: Changed the "flag" options to take optional
    arguments instead of simply assuming "true" when the option was given.
    Unfortunately, getopt_long() is too stupid to handle them properly, which
    means clustered options (e.g. -rRc) can no longer be used.  They must be
    separated (e.g. -r -R -c).  Also, arguments given with the short version
    must not be separated by a space (e.g. -l3).
  NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE: Renamed the long command line option "use-syslog"
    to "log-level".
  Fixed middleman() to completely bypass all processing when TLS passthrough is
    active.  The additional processing was buffering TLS traffic until the data
    contained a newline character (purely by coincidence).  This buffering was
    preventing the passthrough from functioning properly.  Thanks to Dominik
    Dausch for reporting this one.

VERSION 2.6.3 -- 6/21/2007
  Fixed a serious bug where spamdyke was closing the connection to qmail and
    exiting as soon as the remote host exited.  When the remote host sends its
    SMTP data in one burst and closes the connection without waiting for the
    response code from the DATA segment, qmail doesn't accept the message and
    nothing gets delivered.
  Added some code to log_writeln() to translate bare carriage returns into
    carriage return/linefeed combinations.  This allows poorly written remote
    servers to send mail, most notably Microsoft web servers.  Dogmatically
    refusing to accept mail by refusing to be more flexible than RFC 822
    will never change the world; let's be reasonable instead of bouncing
    messages back to our friends who can't change their mail servers anyway.
  Fixed smtp_filter() to accept parameters to AUTH LOGIN when the MUA sends the
    authentication information with the command instead of waiting for the
    prompts.  Thanks to Carlo Blohm for reporting this one.

VERSION 2.6.2 -- 6/7/2007
  Fixed smtp_filter() to accept parameters to AUTH PLAIN when the MUA sends the
    authentication information with the command instead of waiting for another
    prompt.
  Changed find_address() to strip BATV tags from addresses so whitelist/
    blacklist matching can still take place.  Reported by Walter Russo.
  Added utils/passwordcheck to help troubleshoot SMTP AUTH problems.
  Added more logging to exec_checkpassword() to aid troubleshooting.

VERSION 2.6.1 -- 6/4/2007
  Changed calls to tolower() and isalnum() to eliminate warnings from gcc 3.3.3
    on NetBSD 3.1.  Thanks to David Frese for reporting this one.
  Fixed a very small typo in the new mask/flag system that was preventing
    spamdyke from advertising SMTP AUTH on unpatched qmail servers --
    FILTER_FLAG_AUTH_ADD had the same value as FILTER_FLAG_AUTH_NONE.  Oops.
    Thanks to Renato Franzin for reporting this one.
  Fixed an oversight in the use of gethostbyname() to perform DNS lookups for A
    records.  If the server is configured to search a domain for matching names
    ("search" in /etc/resolv.conf) and the domain has a wildcard DNS entry, the
    DNS RBL code was always matching because an A record was always found. 
    Adding a dot to the end of the queried name prevents the domain searching
    and returns correct results.  Thanks to "Paolo", Alexander Fordyce and Jens
    Mickerts for reporting and helping me troubleshoot this one.

VERSION 2.6.0 -- 5/29/2007
  Added support for STARTTLS, similar to the way SMTP AUTH is implemented -- if
    a server certificate is available, spamdyke takes care of the TLS.  If not
    but qmail supports TLS, spamdyke passes it through.
  Changed the read() and write() calls to the network to use macros named
    NETWORK_READ() and NETWORK_WRITE() that are replaced by TLS routines when
    TLS support has been compiled in.
  Changed the smtp_filter() return codes to use a mask/flag system because the
    possible permutations of PASS/INTERCEPT/QUIT with ADD/REMOVE/CAPTURE AUTH
    and ADD/REMOVE/CAPTURE TLS and CHILD QUIT/CONTINUE were getting too complex.
  Fixed search_file() to match a file entry where the search text matches the
    entry completely but the entry has wildcard markers at the start and/or end.
  Added TLS support to tests/sendrecv so TLS can be tested from scripts.
  Fixed numerous small bugs in tests/sendrecv that were causing inaccurate test
    results (false positives and false negatives).
  Updated all of the test scripts to make renumbering them easier.
  Added a new test script to exercise a small whitelist wildcard bug I found.
  Added 10 new test scripts to exercise the new TLS features.
  Changed process_command_line() and usage() to print a brief usage message if
    no parameters are given.
  Changed process_command_line() and usage() to print a brief error message if
    a bad parameter is given.
  Changed process_command_line() and usage() to print the full usage message if
    -h or --help is given.
  Changed process_command_line() and usage() to print the version header if -v
    or --version is given.
  Renamed test_smtpauth_crammd5, test_smtpauth_login and test_smtpauth_plain to
    smtpauth_crammd5, smtpauth_login and smtpauth_plain, respectively.
  Moved smtpauth_crammd5, smtpauth_login and smtpauth_plain from the utils
    folder to tests/smtpauth, since they're only used by the test scripts
    anyway.
  Added alternate command line options for people who spell "gray" with an "e".
    They do the same thing.
  Updated the documentation.

VERSION 2.5.0 -- 5/7/2007
  Moved portions of spamdyke's code from spamdyke.c into new .c and .h files to
    make it a little easier to understand and maintain.
  Added base64_encode() and base64_decode() to transfer data to/from base64
    format.
  Added md5() to produce an MD5 digest of a data block.  Turns out this wasn't
    necessary for spamdyke, only for test_smtpauth_crammd5.  Oops.
  Renamed the "make openbsd" command to "make bsd" since apparently all *BSD
    distributions don't need -lresolv.
  Renamed search_ip_file() to search_tcprules_file() and extended it to support
    IP ranges, rDNS names and remote info like tcprules does (according to
    http://cr.yp.to/ucspi-tcp/tcprules.html).  This makes the IP black/
    whitelist files much more flexible.  This will be much handier in the next
    version (AKA The Great Configuration Overhaul).
  Modified middleman() and smtp_filter(), added exec_checkpassword() so spamdyke
    can do SMTP AUTH, either by offering it itself or observing the qmail
    traffic.  LOGIN, PLAIN and CRAM-MD5 are supported.
  Changed the STRLEN_ macros in spamdyke.h to use a single STRLEN() macro so the
    preprocessor will count characters instead of doing it by hand.  Much safer
    this way.
  Removed "-a"'s (max number of recipients per message) dependence on "-d"
    (local domains file).  With SMTP AUTH, the local access file and whitelists,
    this shouldn't be necessary.
  Added process_access() to process local access files (e.g. /etc/tcp.smtp) and
    export environment variables based on the source of the incoming connection.
  Added relay prevention based on the content of the local access file(s) and
    the list(s) of local domains.  Connections from remote sources that are
    granted relay permission in the access file(s) are allowed to relay.  Users
    who authenticate with SMTP AUTH are allowed to relay.  All others must send
    to local addresses only.
  Added a series of test scripts to exercise all of spamdyke's filters and
    options.  This should make it easier to regression test new versions.
  Changed search_file() and search_tcprules_file() to compare domain names in a
    case insensitive manner.
  Changed canonicalize_path() to reduce all file paths to lowercase.  This was
    causing graylisting to be inconsistant.  Reported by bcarr@purgatoire.org.

VERSION 2.4.0 -- 4/9/2007
  Added search_ip_file() to search files for IP addresses and allow wildcards,
    network sizes (numbers of bits, e.g. 11.22.33.44/16) and netmasks (e.g.
    11.22.33.0/255.255.255.0).
  Added new options to allow graylisting exclusions by IP address and rDNS
    name.
  Added new options to activate graylisting for only certain IP addresses and
    rDNS names.
  Updated the documentation.

VERSION 2.3.1 -- 4/2/2007
  Added some explicit casting to printf("%.*s") arguments to make them ints
    instead of longs.  gcc 3.3 on OpenBSD was complaining.
  Changed a datatype in log_write() from long to time_t.  gcc 3.3 on OpenBSD
    was complaining.
  Changed all uses of sprintf() to snprintf(), even though they were already
    safe from buffer overruns.  gcc 3.3 on OpenBSD was complaining.
  Added a new target to the Makefile in the spamdyke and utils folders named
    "openbsd" that compiles without the "-lresolv" flag.  gcc 3.3 on OpenBSD
    includes the resolver library automatically and throws an error when it
    is explicitly specified.
  Added some additional #include directives in dnsmx.c, dnsptr.c and dnstxt.c
    because they're not included by resolv.h on OpenBSD.

VERSION 2.3.0 -- 4/2/2007
  Gained a broader understanding of the resolver library and DNS packet
    structure, then rewrote most of dns_txt() and dns_ptr_lookup() to (more)
    correctly process DNS data.
  Added dns_mx() to perform MX record lookups.
  Changed process_command_line() to use getopt_long() and added long option
    equivalents to the existing command line flags.
  Added the option "reject-missing-sender-mx" to reject email from senders
    whose domains aren't local and don't have MX records and/or A records.
    AOL does this.
  Updated the usage statement to show the new (long) command line options.
  Updated the README.txt to show the new (long) command line options.
  Moved domain2path and domainsplit into a new folder named "utils".
  Created dnsmx, dnsptr and dnstxt in the utils folder by copying the dns_mx(),
    dns_ptr() and dns_txt() functions from spamdyke.  They are simple command
    line utilities that no one will ever use except as examples of how to make
    MX, PTR and TXT DNS queries using libc.  As far as Google knows, there are
    no such examples anywhere else on the internet.
  Changed the DNS RBL code to check for A records in addition to TXT records.
    Some RBLs are using A records, I don't know why.
  Fixed the DNS RBL code not to check 127.0.0.1 for RBL entries.

VERSION 2.2.1 -- 3/20/2007
  Fixed a signed/unsigned mismatch in domainsplit and spamdyke caused by
    assigning integer function returns to char variables while testing their
    values.  Reported by David Frese.
  Added an entry to the FAQ.

VERSION 2.2.0 -- 3/19/2007
  Changed all uses of atoi() to sscanf() so conversion errors can be detected.
  Changed is_ip_in_name() to convert the ip octets to integers once instead of
    multiple times in different tests.
  Changed search_file() to allow wildcards at the start and end of the lines in
    the file.
  Changed the sender blacklist code to allow '@' wildcards at the start of the
    line so entire domains can be blocked.
  Changed the recipient blacklist code to allow '@' wildcards at the start and
    end of the line so entire domains can be blocked or a username can be
    blocked across all domains.
  Changed the IP blacklist code to allow '.' wildcards at the end of the line.
  Changed the rDNS whitelist code to allow '.' wildcards at the start of the
    line.
  Changed the IP whitelist code to allow '.' wildcards at the end of the line.
  Moved the command line processing code into a new function named
    process_command_line() and added fields to the filter_settings structure to
    save values that had previously been immediately tested and discarded.
    This function also clears the way for reading configuration items from a
    source other than the command line (e.g. a configuration file).
  Modified the filter_settings structure and related code to allow multiple
    values to be given for the local domains file, the rDNS blacklist keywords
    file, the rDNS blacklist directory, the IP blacklist file, the rDNS
    whitelist file and the IP whitelist file.
  Added a new function named run_tests() to run the tests requested on the
    command line.  This eliminates the "in-order" nonsense.  Tests now always
    run in a specific order, from least expensive to most expensive.  This
    function also clears the way for a single filter_settings structure to be
    evaluated for multiple connections.
  Updated README.txt to include better/updated details.
  Added FAQ.txt to contain some common questions and answers.

VERSION 2.1.0 -- 3/1/2007
  Changed the returned SMTP errors to use permanent error codes when the sender
    is blacklisted, the recipient address is not fully qualified, the recipient
    is blacklisted, the remote IP address is found on a DNSRBL, the remote rDNS
    name is blacklisted, the remote IP address is blacklisted, the remote rDNS
    name contains the remote IP address, or the remote server is an earlytalker.
    Temporary error codes are still sent when the remote server's rDNS name
    can't be found or if it doesn't resolve, just in case the DNS server is
    slow.  Temporary error codes are obviously used for graylisting and limiting
    the number of recipients.  This change resulted in an 80% drop in traffic
    overnight.  Is it possible spammers do clean their lists?  Nah...
  Added a copyright statement to the top of domain2path.c.
  Added the domainsplit utility, since it needed a home anyway and it's useful
    in scripts.
  Changed the syslog error messages to include a description of the error when
    possible, especially for filesystem-related errors.
  Fixed check_rdns_keywords() to not log an "unable to open file" error if the
    rDNS name doesn't exist anyway.

VERSION 2.0.0 -- 2/23/2007
  Updated dns_ptr() to chase CNAME entries when looking for PTR entries, since
    a lot of ISPs use CNAMEs to delegate reverse DNS to their subscribers.
  Changed the rDNS blacklist to use a directory structure instead of a flat
    file, since searching a large file on a busy system takes too much CPU.

VERSION 1.1.0 -- 1/31/2007
  Added a version string and copyright statement to the usage message.
  Changed the graylisting and full logging features to set their file modes to
    0600 to help protect users' privacy.
  Added recipient blacklisting (-S).
  Added an rDNS lookup function so spamdyke can do its own DNS work instead of
    relying on tcpserver (which doesn't always do it).
  Other small bug fixes.
  Added a README.txt file with full explanations of all spamdyke's features.

VERSION 1.0.0 -- 1/25/2007
  Initial version.
