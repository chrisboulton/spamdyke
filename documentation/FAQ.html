<h2>What is spamdyke and what does it do?</h2>
<p>
In a sentence, spamdyke is a drop-in qmail filter for stopping spam at
connection-time.
</p><p>
"drop-in" means it can be installed without patching or recompiling qmail,
without installing or updating libraries, without drastically reconfiguring
anything and without having to become a qmail expert.
</p><p>
"connection-time" means spamdyke evaluates and rejects spam while the remote
server is still delivering it.  Other filters and anti-spam solutions focus on
classifying spam after qmail has accepted it.  The spam still has to go
somewhere.  Even if it's filed in a folder, it still occupies disk space,
consumes server resources and must be deleted by someone.  When spamdyke rejects
the incoming spam completely, no one has to deal with it.  It's never on the
server at all.
</p><p>
For a complete description of spamdyke and all its features, see the <a href="README.html">README page</a>.
</p>

<a name="GEN2"></a>
<h2>I use email but I don't administer my own mail server. Can I use spamdyke?</h2>
<p>
Unfortunately, no.  spamdyke must be installed by a mail administrator.  It cannot be installed or used by end users, sorry.
</p>

<a name="GEN3"></a>
<h2>How do I install spamdyke?</h2>
<p>
For installation instructions, see the <a href="INSTALL.txt">INSTALL.txt file</a>.
</p>

<a name="GEN4"></a>
<h2>How do I upgrade spamdyke?  What's the significance of the version numbers?</h2>
<p>
Typically, upgrading spamdyke is as simple as compiling the new version and
copying the new <code>spamdyke</code> binary over the old one.  However, sometimes
the new version is not backwards-compatible with the old version and simply replacing
the binary will cause problems.  The <a href="UPGRADING.txt">UPGRADING.txt file</a> has
details on the backwards-compatibility of each version.
</p><p>
The version numbers are used to show the type of changes in each version:
<ul>
<li>When major, non-backwards-compatible changes are made, the "major" version
number is incremented.  For example, 3.0.0 is not completely backwards compatible
with 2.6.3, so the major version number changed from 2 to 3.</li>
<li>When new, backwards-compatible features are added, only the "minor" version
number is incremented.  For example, 3.1.0 includes new features but is backwards
compatible with 3.0.0, so the minor version number changed from 0 to 1.</li>
<li>When no features are added but bugs are fixed, only the "revision" version number
is incremented.  For example, 3.0.1 only contained bug fixes, so the revision
version number changed from 0 to 1.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<a name="GEN5"></a>
<h2>How do I get support for spamdyke?  Is there a mailing list?</h2>
<p>
Yes!  Visit the mailing list page to sign up: <a href="http://www.spamdyke.org/mailman/listinfo/spamdyke-users">www.spamdyke.org/mailman/listinfo/spamdyke-users</a>.
The mailing list archives are searchable at: <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/spamdyke-users@spamdyke.org">www.mail-archive.com/spamdyke-users@spamdyke.org</a>.
</p><p>
All of the documentation and releases can be found at on the spamdyke
website at <a href="http://www.spamdyke.org/">spamdyke.org</a>.
</p><p>
If you can't find answers there, send an email to me at:
<a href="mailto:samc%40silence%2Eorg">samc (at) silence (dot) org</a>

<a name="GEN6"></a>
<h2>I don't use qmail.  Can I still use spamdyke?</h2>
<p>
Not at this time.
</p><p>
Some background: Qmail starts a new process (<code>qmail-smtpd</code>) from a listening
daemon (<code>tcpserver</code> or <code>xinetd</code>) every time a new connection is established.  spamdyke slips
in between those two, so the daemon starts a new copy of spamdyke for each
connection and spamdyke starts the qmail process.
</p><p>
Most other mail servers don't work this way; they use a single long-running
daemon for handling incoming requests.  There's no way to insert spamdyke
without rewriting the mail server daemon (no thanks!).
</p><p>
Having said that, spamdyke could be modified to listen for incoming connections
itself (replacing qmail's tcpserver) and establish a new connection to the
"real" server (presumably listening on a different port, perhaps running on a
different interface or machine).  This requires some refactoring in the spamdyke
code but it's not an insurmountable task.
</p><p>
Look for this feature in a future version.
</p>

<a name="GEN7"></a>
<h2>Do I have to install the programs from the "utils" directory?  Does spamdyke use
them?  Do they use spamdyke or each other?</h2>
<p>
No.  domainsplit, domain2path and timefilter are just small utilities for use in writing
scripts.  spamdyke doesn't use them or depend on them.  Conversely, they don't
use or depend on spamdyke.
</p><p>
dnsa, dnsmx, dnsns, dnsptr, dnssoa and dnstxt are just small, self-contained examples of how to make
A, MX, NS, PTR, SOA and TXT DNS queries using libc.  They're not really useful on their own.
I made them available because I was looking for examples like them when I was
writing the DNS code in spamdyke and I couldn't find any.  Hopefully someone
else will be able to learn from them.  Aren't I just a swell guy?
</p>

<a name="GEN8"></a>
<h2>When I reconfigure spamdyke, do I have to restart qmail?</h2>
<p>
Usually not but it depends on what you've done.
</p><p>
You do not need to restart qmail when you:
<ul>
<li>Replace the spamdyke binary</li>
<li>Edit spamdyke's configuration file</li>
<li>Edit a file in a configuration directory</li>
<li>Edit a file referenced from spamdyke's configuration (e.g. adding IP addresses to a whitelist file)</li>
</ul>
</p><p>
You must restart qmail when you:
<ul>
<li>Edit spamdyke's command line</li>
</ul>
</p>

<a name="GEN9"></a>
<h2>What is the difference between a right-hand-side blacklist (RHSBL) and a realtime blackhole list (RBL)?</h2>
<p>
<dl>
<dt>Right-hand-side blacklists (RHSBLs) are lists of domain names.  The name refers to the "right-hand side"
of an email address -- the portion after the "@" symbol.</dt>
<dd>Advantage: all email from a domain will be blocked, even if the spammer uses many different
servers in different locations (or a botnet).</dd>
<dd>Advantage: RHSBLs can be used to validate a message in multiple ways: the rDNS name
of the remote server can be checked, the envelope sender's domain name can be checked and the "From"
address can be checked (spamdyke does not run this third test).</dd>
<dd>Disadvantage: RHSBLs require more network activity to check than RBLs.</dd>
<dd>Disadvantage: sender addresses are very easy to forge.  If a domain name is being
abused by a spammer, it could be blocked even though the real owners are sending
legitimate email.
</dl>
</p><p>
<dl>
<dt>Realtime blackhole lists (RBLs) are lists of IP addresses.</dt>
<dd>Advantage: all email from a specific server will be blocked, no matter what domain it appears
to come from.  This makes RBLs an effective defense against botnets that use randomly generated
sender addresses.</dd>
<dd>Advantage: RBLs can easily block entire ranges of IP addresses.  This is useful when a
spammer hosts many servers on leased/owned/stolen blocks of IP addresses.</dd>
<dd>Advantage: RBLs require less network activity to check than RHSBLs.
<dd>Disadvantage: RBLs block IP addresses without regard to the sender address; a single
compromised/malicious user can cause the entire server to be blocked.</dd>
</dl>
</p><p>
<dl>
<dt>Advantages of both RHSBLs and RBLs:</dt>
<dd>By using a list maintained by someone else, you don't have to update a blacklist yourself.</dd>
</dl>
</p><p>
<dl>
<dt>Disadvantages of both RHSBLs and RBLs</dt>
<dd>Both RHSBLs and RBLs require network activity to use, which incurs a performance penalty.  If
too many lists are used, the time/bandwidth required to check them all may cause unacceptable delays.
<dd>By using a list maintained by someone else, your (and your users') email is at someone else's
mercy.  You are responsible for your server, so be sure you understand the list administrator's
policies before you use their blacklist.</dd>
</dl>
</p>

<a name="GEN10"></a>
<h2>Which RBLs and/or RHSBLs do you recommend?</h2>
<p>
None.  Blacklists are a sensitive issue.  Their legal status is uncertain, depending on what country
and area you (and they) live in.
</p><p>
Blacklist operators each have different policies about how entries are placed on the list and how
they are removed.  Some operators are very forgiving, others are not.  For some, a simple delisting
request is enough while others require more elaborate "proof" a server/domain has "been reformed".
Some require money.  Many operators have been known to list huge blocks of IP addresses or domains
in order to pressure an ISP to cancel a spammer's service.  This effectively recruits all of the
list's subscribers into a large group to boycott the ISP's services.
</p><p>
For all of those reasons, I am not willing to endorse any specific list (although I use several myself).
You must decide for yourself if you are comfortable with a list operator's policies.  Be sure to
look for complaints against about the list and responses from the operators.  Sometimes those can be
the best indicator of a list operator's true attitude.
</p>

<a name="GEN11"></a>
<h2>What operating systems and versions do you test spamdyke with?</h2>
<p>
On the following systems, spamdyke's configuration script executes correctly, it compiles
without errors or warnings and displays its usage message:
<ul>
<li>Apple OS X 10.6</li>
<li>CentOS 5.2 64-bit</li>
<li>Fedora Core 4</li>
<li>FreeBSD 2.2.2</li>
<li>FreeBSD 4.7</li>
<li>FreeBSD 6.0</li>
<li>NetBSD 3.1</li>
<li>OpenBSD 4.3</li>
<li>Solaris 10 x86</li>
</ul>
</p><p>
spamdyke's test scripts execute correctly on the following systems:
<ul>
<li>Fedora Core 4, netqmail 1.03 (patched with TLS and SMTP AUTH) and vpopmail 5.4.10</li>
<li>OpenBSD 4.3, netqmail 1.03 (no additional patches) and vpopmail 5.4.10</li>
</ul>
If you are unable to configure or compile spamdyke correctly, please send an email to
<a href="mailto:samc%40silence%2Eorg">samc (at) silence (dot) org</a> so the errors can
be fixed and your system can be added to the list of test environments.
</p>

<a name="GEN12"></a>
<h2>I love spamdyke!  How can I help?  Can I send you money?</h2>
<p>
Thank you for your generosity, but I must decline donations.  I started writing spamdyke to meet my own needs.
I continue writing it as a hobby, not to make money.  I get much more pleasure and motivation from reading thank-you emails than
I would from the occasional donation.
</p><p>
If you want to help, there are several ways:
<ul>
<li>Spread the word about spamdyke.  Let others know, create links to this site, post an article on your blog, etc.  Everyone hates spam and statistics are very persuasive.</li>
<li>Join the spamdyke-users mailing list and help answer questions.  The spamdyke community is growing and it needs support.</li>
<li>Join the spamdyke-dev mailing list and help test new versions before they are released.  Remember Linus' Law: <i>Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow.</i></li>
<li>Proofread the documentation and suggest improvements.  Write tutorials for installing spamdyke.  Translate existing documentation into other languages.</li>
<li>If you are a C programmer, send an email to <a href="mailto:samc%40silence%2Eorg">samc (at) silence (dot) org</a> and volunteer to implement a new feature.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<a name="FEATURE1"></a>
<h2>Does spamdyke run its filters in any particular order?</h2>
<p>
Yes.  spamdyke evaluates its filters in the following order (of course a filter
is skipped if it's disabled):
<dl>
<dd>Check if mail is being accepted or filtered at all
<dd>Check for an rDNS name
<dd>Check for an IP address in a country code rDNS name
<dd>Check for an rDNS whitelist entry
<dd>Check for an rDNS blacklist entry
<dd>Check for an IP whitelist entry
<dd>Check for an IP blacklist entry
<dd>Check for an IP address and keyword in the rDNS name
<dd>Check if the rDNS name resolves
<dd>Check DNS whitelists
<dd>Check right-hand-side whitelists
<dd>Check DNS RBLs
<dd>Check right-hand-side blacklists
<dd>Check for earlytalkers
</dl>
</p><p>
The intent is to order the filters from least-to-most expensive, so connections
will be rejected as quickly as possible.  In a typical setup, DNS queries are
more expensive than file searches, pattern matching is more expensive than
simply checking for a file's existence, etc.
</p><p>
The remaining filters are all checked during the SMTP conversation.
<dl>
<dd>Check sender whitelists
<dd>Check right-hand-side whitelists for the sender's domain name 
<dd>Check sender blacklists
<dd>Check right-hand-side blacklists for the sender's domain name 
<dd>Check for sender's domain MX record
<dd>Check recipient whitelists
<dd>Block relaying from unauthorized remote hosts
<dd>Limit the number of recipients
<dd>Block unqualified recipient addresses
<dd>Check recipient blacklists
<dd>Check for identical sender and recipient addresses
<dd>Graylisting
</dl>
If spamdyke is passing TLS traffic to qmail without processing (i.e.
spamdyke wasn't compiled with TLS support or doesn't have access to the server
certificate), none of these filters are run.
</p><p>
When spamdyke's <code>config-dir</code> option is in use, no filters are
run until after the remote server gives the recipient's address.  This is
because spamdyke must load any additional configuration files before it
will know which filters to run.
</p>

<a name="FEATURE2"></a>
<h2>If spamdyke checks IP blacklists before it checks sender whitelists, will whitelisted senders from blacklisted IPs be blocked?</h2>
<p>
No.  Whitelists (all whitelists) <b>always</b> override all blacklists and all other filters.
The order in which spamdyke checks the whitelists is not relevant; spamdyke will check all whitelists
before it rejects a connection.
</p>

<a name="FEATURE3"></a>
<h2>My users authenticate with SMTP AUTH.  Can I still use spamdyke?</h2>
<p>
Yes!  As of version 2.5.0, spamdyke understands SMTP AUTH and disables all of
its filtering for authenticated users.
</p><p>
See the <a href="README.html">README page</a> for complete details.
</p>

<a name="FEATURE4"></a>
<h2>My users authenticate with POP3-before-SMTP.  Can I still use spamdyke?</h2>
<p>
Probably not.  If your POP3 server writes authenticated IP addresses to
a file, you can use that file as an IP whitelist with spamdyke.  If it keeps
track of authenticated IP addresses in some other way, you're out of luck.
</p><p>
For example, Plesk supports POP3-before-SMTP but it writes the authenticated IP addresses to its
database, which spamdyke cannot read.
</p><p>
POP3-before-SMTP is really a kludge anyway; consider using SMTP AUTH instead.
</p>

<a name="FEATURE5"></a>
<h2>I want to block all emails unless the sender authenticates.  Can spamdyke do that?</h2>
<p>
Yes.  As of version 4.0.0, spamdyke accepts the <code>smtp-auth-level</code> option.  When it is set to <code>require-auth</code>,
all connections are rejected unless the sender has authenticated.
</p><p>
Prior to version 4.0.0, the easiest way to accomplish this was to first enable SMTP AUTH.  Then, create an IP blacklist file that will block all IP addresses:
<dl>
<dd><code>0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0</code>
</dl>
spamdyke will disable its filters for authenticated users and block everyone else.
</p>

<a name="FEATURE6"></a>
<h2>Does spamdyke support TLS?</h2>
<p>
As of version 2.6.0, spamdyke supports TLS (which is just another name for SSL).
spamdyke will detect TLS and pass it through seamlessly.  Obviously, none of its
post-connect filters will work (e.g. graylisting) because all of the traffic will
be encrypted.
</p><p>
However, if spamdyke has access to a server certificate, it will handle the TLS
itself and all of its filters will work as before.  Bonus: spamdyke will provide
TLS even if your qmail has not been patched to provide TLS!
</p><p>
As of version 4.0.0, spamdyke supports SMTP-over-SSL (SMTPS) when the <code>tls-level</code>
option is set to <code>smtps</code>.
</p><p>
See the <a href="README.html">README page</a> for complete details.
</p>

<a name="FEATURE7"></a>
<h2>I want to whitelist a large number of IP addresses; can I use wildcards?</h2>
<p>
Yes, as of spamdyke version 2.2.0.  The whitelist and blacklist IP
files will work with partial IP addresses to represent ranges.
</p><p>
As of spamdyke version 2.4.0, whitelist and blacklist IP files can also
contain IP addresses as dotted quad IP address followed by a netmask as a number
of bits.  Also, spamdyke supports dotted quad IP addresses followed by a netmask
as a dotted quad.
</p><p>
As of spamdyke version 3.0.0, whitelisted IP addresses can also be found
by using a DNS realtime whitelist.  This is like a DNS RBL that lists whitelisted
IP addresses instead of blacklisted ones.
</p><p>
For complete details, see the <a href="README.html">README page</a>.
</p>

<a name="FEATURE8"></a>
<h2>I want to disable some filters for a few domains and enable them for everyone else.  Is that possible?</h2>
<p>
Yes, as of spamdyke version 4.0.0.  Configuration directories allow per-domain
configuration of most of spamdyke's features.
</p><p>
For example, imagine the following scenario:
The system administrator wants to check all connections for rDNS names (<code>reject-missing-rdns</code>),
for rDNS name resolution (<code>reject-unresolvable-rdns</code>) and for their IP address
with a keyword in their rDNS name (<code>ip-in-rdns-keyword-blacklist-file</code>).  However, the
recipients in one domain, example.com, don't like the unresolvable rDNS name filter or the
keyword filter; they want those two disabled.
</p><p>
To accomplish this, spamdyke's main configuration file might contain the following
options:
<dl>
<dd><code>reject-missing-rdns=1</code></dd>
<dd><code>reject-unresolvable-rdns=1</code></dd>
<dd><code>ip-in-rdns-keyword-blacklist-file=/etc/spamdyke/rdns_keywords.txt</code></dd>
<dd><code>config-dir=/etc/spamdyke/config.d</code></dd>
</dl>
To disable the two filters for all recipients at example.com, the following options
would appear in a file named <code>/etc/spamdyke/config.d/_recipient_/com/example</code>:
<dl>
<dd><code>reject-unresolvable-rdns=0</code></dd>
<dd><code>ip-in-rdns-keyword-blacklist-file=!!!</code></dd>
</dl>
Configuration directories can be used to accomplish many complex tasks.  For example,
if the file for a specific domain contained options to read blacklist and whitelist
files from the domain owner's home directory, the domain owner could update their own
blacklists and whitelists without help from the system administrator!
</p><p>
For complete details, see the <a href="README.html#CONFIGURATION_DIR">Configuration Directory documentation</a>.
</p>

<a name="FEATURE9"></a>
<h2>My users' PCs are infected with spambots and are sending spam through my server.  Can I force them to authenticate to block the spam?</h2>
<p>
Yes.  See the above question (<a href="#FEATURE8">I want to disable some filters for a few domains and enable them for everyone else.  Is that possible?</a>).
In the configuration directory for each of your local domains, add the option:
<dl>
<dd><code>filter-level=require-auth</code></dd>
</dl>
</p>

<a name="SUGGESTION0"></a>
<h2>On the mailing list, you often promise changes in an upcoming version.  How can I find out what you're working on?</h2>
<p>
The easiest way is to simply ask.  Send an email.
</p><p>
Other than that, check out the <a href="TODO.txt">TODO.txt file</a>.
The file contains notes to indicate the intended major changes
in the next few versions.  Those notes are not a completely accurate predictor of
what will happen but they'll give you an idea of what's happening.
</p>

<a name="SUGGESTION1"></a>
<h2>Why doesn't spamdyke use CDB files or a database?  A database would be faster and better
than text files and strange directory structures!</h2>
<p>
Reasons why files and directory structures are preferable to databases:
<ol>
<li><b>Speed.</b>  Because spamdyke doesn't run as a daemon, a database 
engine must be loaded and initialized for every incoming connection. 
That takes time, so the database engine must be <i>very</i> fast to keep the 
overall time lower than using plain text files.</li>
<li><b>Memory.</b>  Because one copy of spamdyke is started for every 
incoming connection, memory usage is a big concern on busy servers.  Most 
qmail installations use DJB's softlimit program to limit memory usage 
for exactly this reason.  Database libraries use memory, often quite a 
bit, to load/cache/parse data.  spamdyke must be able to fit within a 
reasonable limit.</li>
<li><b>Concurrency.</b>  On a busy mail server, hundreds (possibly thousands) 
of spamdyke processes could be running at the same time.  A database 
engine would have to handle that kind of simultaneous access without 
failing.</li>
<li><b>Portability.</b>  At the moment, spamdyke runs on every Unix-like 
platform I've tested.  The only external library it uses is OpenSSL (for 
TLS support) and even that is optional.  I believe spamdyke's simplicity 
is largely responsible for its popularity -- nothing extra must be 
installed, no existing programs must be recompiled.  Requiring a mail 
server administrator to install a database engine could scare away 
potential users.</li>
<li><b>Accessibility.</b>  By using only plain text files and
directories, spamdyke is easy for anyone to administer and reconfigure 
with standard command line tools.  Any administrator can understand a 
file of whitelisted IP addresses without help.  Very few administrators 
know SQL.  This is very important to me -- I hate proprietary file 
formats that can only be accessed with special tools.  I can't remember 
how many times I've stared at a malfunctioning Sendmail server and been 
unable to determine if a given option was even available, much less 
enabled.  This point and the next point are very closely related.</li>
<li><b>Safety.</b>  Plain text files and directories are easy to understand, 
easy to back up and easy to restore.  They can be printed out, emailed, 
imported into other programs, etc.  Most importantly, it's very 
difficult to corrupt a plain text file by "improperly" stopping spamdyke 
or losing power.  In an emergency, when an administrator is trying to 
restore a mail server while users are screaming at him, I don't want him 
wondering if spamdyke's files are intact.  If he has any doubts, he 
should be able to visually verify them with any available text editor.
(I've had to restore corrupted Exchange Private Mail Stores 
in the middle of the night. I wouldn't wish that experience on anyone.)</li>
<li><b>Availability.</b>  Mail servers should depend on as few external 
systems as possible.  spamdyke already depends heavily on DNS but that's 
unfortunately unavoidable.   I've done everything I can to make sure 
spamdyke fails gracefully if DNS is down.  Fortunately, DNS servers are 
(usually) very stable and very reliable.  Database engines are not in 
the same league -- while many databases are fairly reliable they still 
have much higher downtime than DNS servers.  As stated above, I don't want to 
force a stressed administrator to restore his database server just to 
get mail flowing again.  If I were forced to do that, I would choose 
instead to uninstall spamdyke (and I would never use it again).</li>
</ol>
</p><p>
Database servers like MySQL conflict with all 7 points.
Embedded database engines like SQLite conflict with points 1, 2, 5 and 6.
CDB files conflict with points 5 and 6.
</p><p>
This doesn't mean spamdyke will <i>never</i> use a database.
It just means there's a lot to think about.  A database
would have to solve a really tough problem before it would be considered.
Whether it saves some coding time is really not a factor -- the 
time required to install and administer spamdyke is more important.

<h2>Why doesn't spamdyke filter using Sender Policy Framework (SPF), Sender ID, Certified Server Validation (CSV),
DomainKeys or DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM)?</h2>
<p>
Each of those systems is very complex, so adding support to
spamdyke will not be a small task.  They're also all different, so supporting
all of them would be a major undertaking.  At this point, there are other ways
to improve spamdyke that will take less effort and provide much more benefit.
</p><p>
Additionally, I'm not convinced any of those systems will make any difference.
They were each designed to prevent spam being sent from forged addreses so, for
example, you won't get spam from president@whitehouse.gov.  However, most
spammers own their domains (often many thousands of them) and control their
own DNS, so they can (and do) add SPF/CSV/etc records so their spam follows the
SPF/CSV/etc rules.  (Hint: Spammers understand and administer their DNS records
better than most ISPs do.)  The major ISPs (AOL, Yahoo!, GMail) use these
systems and still have spam problems; this is pretty good evidence they aren't
living up to the hype.
</p><p>
There is a (small) chance these systems could stop spam coming from botnets.
If that happens however, the spammers will just start relaying their spam
through the compromised machine's ISP's mail servers.  (Hint: That's why having every
ISP block all outbound port 25 traffic won't stop botnet spam either.)
</p><p>
If you really, really want to filter your email using one or more of these
frameworks, try using SpamAssassin.  It already supports most of them and you'll
be able to judge their effectiveness for yourself.

<h2>Why can't spamdyke filter based on message headers like "From:" or "Received:"?
Why can't spamdyke block large messages or strip attachments?</h2>
<p>
To understand why, a little explanation of the SMTP protocol is necessary.
</p><p>
After some conversational preliminaries, an SMTP client gives the server a
sender address.  This address is referred to as the "envelope
sender" and it's used as a return address if the message bounces.  Here's the
part most users don't understand: The "envelope sender" doesn't have to be the
same address you see on the "From" line.  The two aren't related at all; the
"From" line is mostly for show (this is why spam "From" lines are so often
forged).
</p><p>
If the server accepts the "envelope sender" address, the client sends the
addresses of the message recipients, one at a time.  The recipient addresses
are for message delivery.  The server must accept or reject each recipient individually.
Once again, the "To" and "Cc" lines aren't related at all; they're mostly for show.
</p><p>
If the server accepts one or more recipients, the client sends the message.
The server accepts or rejects the message and the conversation is over.
</p><p>
spamdyke makes a decision whether to accept or reject senders and recipients
during the first two steps because those steps must be acknowleged separately.
Once the client sends the actual message, it can't be rejected.
</p><p>
Well, yes, technically, according to the RFCs, it can be rejected.  However, most
MTAs don't handle this situation correctly and bounce the message if they see
anything other than a success code after sending the message.  This is a Bad
Thing.  If the rejection was for graylisting, the client won't retry delivery.
If the rejection was for one recipient out of many, the client (and therefore
the sending user) won't understand why the error was given.  The message will
just bounce and that's it.
</p><p>
There are many, many tools for filtering messages based on headers and content
that are far, far smarter and feature-rich than spamdyke.  If you really want to
filter based on message headers, please use one of them in addition to spamdyke.
Personally, I use (and recommend) SpamAssassin and ClamAV.
</p>

<a name="SUGGESTION4"></a>
<h2>Why can't spamdyke validate a recipient address before accepting a message?</h2>
<p>
This would be very nice to have but it's not very easy to
implement.  Qmail doesn't make it easy to determine if an address is valid
and vpopmail (if present) only complicates matters.  Since it's better to
accept spam than reject legitimate email, this feature doesn't exist (yet).
</p><p>
If you have a suggestion or method for checking recipient validity, I'd love to know
about it.  Note: recompiling qmail or reusing qmail's source code is not an option.
</p>

<a name="SUGGESTION5"></a>
<h2>My graylist directories are getting huge -- many, many entries.  Is this is a problem?  What can I do?</h2>
<p>
For most servers, it isn't a problem, since most of the files contain no data.  However,
it might be a problem if the server's filesystem runs out of inodes. (An inode is basically
a file index within the filesystem.  The number of available inodes is large but not infinite;
when a file system runs out of inodes, no new files can be created.)
</p><p>
On most Unix-like systems, the <code>df</code> command will show the amount of free
space on all of the mounted filesystems.  To show the number of available inodes, use
the command <code>df -i</code>.
</p><p>
To remove old graylist files on systems with GNU tools installed, the following command
should work:
<dl>
<dd><code>find GRAYLIST_FOLDER -type f -mmin +$[SPAMDYKE_MAX_GRAYLIST_SECS/60] -print0 | xargs -0 rm -f</code>
</dl>
Be sure to replace <code>GRAYLIST_FOLDER</code> with the path to your graylist directory, as
given in the spamdyke command line or configuration file.  Also replace <code>SPAMDYKE_MAX_GRAYLIST_SECS</code>
with the maximum graylist age from the spamdyke command line (-M) or configuration file.
</p><p>
Be careful about deleting graylist entries -- it is possible to be too aggressive and
delete them before the remote server(s) have finished delivering their message(s).  If
the entries disappear while a remote server is still trying to pass the filter, it will
be graylisted again (and again and again).  Eventually, the remote server wil stop retrying
and the message will bounce back to the sender.  To avoid this, you shouldn't delete any graylist
entries that are less than two weeks old.
</p>

<a name="SUGGESTION6"></a>
<h2>Why can't spamdyke automatically delete old graylist entries?</h2>
<p>
spamdyke doesn't automatically delete old graylist entries because it doesn't run as a
daemon.  In other words, spamdyke doesn't run constantly on the server.  It only runs
while a message is being received.  If spamdyke suddenly decided to clean up the graylist
directory, it would have to do that work while receiving an incoming email message.
</p><p>
If your graylist directory is large, the cleanup could cause a large enough delay 
to bounce the message.  Also, how is spamdyke to decide when to cleanup?  Because
a new spamdyke process is started for each incoming connection and those processes
don't communicate with each other, there's a good chance multiple spamdyke
instances would attempt to cleanup the directory at the same time.  That would delay
multiple incoming messages and place an unnecessary load on the server.
</p>

<a name="SUGGESTION7"></a>
<h2>Instead of trying to prevent relaying itself, why doesn't spamdyke just set the <code>RELAYCLIENT</code>
environment variable based on authentication/sender address/recipient address?</h2>
<p>
Unfortunately, that isn't possible because of the way environment variables work.
</p><p>
Some background: Environment variables are set when a program is started.  Most of the
time, we care about them because the login shell (e.g. bash) keeps a list of environment variables
that it sets for every process that it starts (i.e. when commands are typed at the prompt).
However, each process that runs on a system has an environment, set by the process that
started it (the parent process).  Once the child process has been started, the parent
process cannot alter its environment any more.
</p><p>
More background: When the <code>RELAYCLIENT</code> environment variable is set before
<code>qmail-smtpd</code> is started, qmail will allow the connection to relay.  Typically,
<code>RELAYCLIENT</code> is set in the access file (e.g. <code>/etc/tcp.smtp</code>) based
on the IP address of the remote server.
</p><p>
spamdyke must determine what environment variables to set before it starts the
<code>qmail-smtpd</code> process (because after <code>qmail-smtpd</code> has been
started, spamdyke can't change its environment).  For that reason, spamdyke always sets
the <code>RELAYCLIENT</code> environment if it has enough information to run its relaying
filter.  That way, <code>qmail-smtpd</code> will not prevent relaying
if spamdyke determines it is allowed (e.g. because the connection is whitelisted).
</p><p>
If spamdyke's configuration does not include the access file and a list of the locally
hosted domains, it cannot run its relay filter; it won't set the <code>RELAYCLIENT</code>
environment variable.
</p><p>
As of version 4.0.0, the <code>relay-level</code> option can also be used to more
precisely control spamdyke's relay filter.
</p>

<a name="SUGGESTION8"></a>
<h2>Why can't spamdyke automatically blacklist (or delay) servers that are rejected too many times?</h2>
<p>
Technically, this is not possible because spamdyke of the way spamdyke works.  Without a long-running
daemon to keep track of the statistics and "penalties", each instance of spamdyke would have to perform
the accounting work on its own.  This would take too long and is very likely to be error-prone.
</p><p>
However, even if it were possible, this kind of feature is very problematic, for several reasons.
<ol>
<li>The only way spamdyke could possibly decide to block a server would be to examine its rejection
statistics (i.e. number of rejections per time period exceeds a threshold).  However, if spamdyke
is already rejecting messages, what is the purpose of blacklisting the server?  In effect, that would
enable two filters for blocking a server when one is already enough.
<li>Innocent mistakes by users of large email systems could unfairly penalize every user of
that system.  For example, if an AOL user sends several messages that are rejected, an
automatic blacklist might block all messages from all AOL users.  This is not acceptable.
<li>Malicious users could use an automatic blacklist to conduct a denial-of-service attack.
By sending multiple invalid messages from a victim's server, an attacker could cause the
automatic blacklist to block all messages from the victim server.
</ol>
</p><p>
In summary, an automatic blacklist is likely to cause more problems than it solves.  For that
reason, spamdyke is unlikely to ever contain such a feature.
</p><p>
However, just because spamdyke doesn't offer an automatic blacklist doesn't mean one can't be
created.  A script that analyzes spamdyke's logs and modifies a blacklist file would be just
as effective.
</p>

<a name="SUGGESTION9"></a>
<h2>Why doesn't spamdyke's graylist filter use the IP address of the remote server?</h2>
<p>
At first glance, it seems more effective to use three criteria for graylisting: the sender's email
address, the recipient's email address and the remote server's IP address.  Many graylist filters
do this.  Whether it actually stops more spam is questionable.
</p><p>
However, using the remote server's IP address often causes more problems than it solves.
To understand why, consider a large mail service like GMail, Yahoo! or AOL.  Such providers handle
so many messages that they must use dozens of outbound servers to keep up with the load.  Imagine
this scenario:
<ol>
<li>A user on a large provider sends a message.
<li>Server 1 attempts to deliver it.  The graylist filter creates a graylist entry and rejects the connection.
<li>Server 1 puts the message back in the queue to retry later.
<li>Some time later, server 2 grabs the message and attempts to deliver it. Server 2's IP address is different from server 1's,
so the graylist filter creates a new entry and rejects the connection.
<li>Server 2 puts the message back in the queue to retry later.
<li>Some time later, server 3 grabs the message and attempts to deliver it. Server 3's IP address is different from server 1's and server 2's,
so the graylist filter creates a new entry and rejects the connection.
<li>Server 3 puts the message back in the queue to retry later.
<li>...repeat...
<li>The message is never delivered and bounces back to the sender.
</ol>
By disregarding the remote server's IP address, spamdyke avoids this problem.
</p>

<a name="TROUBLE1"></a>
<h2>Graylisting isn't working!  What am I doing wrong?</h2>
<p>
Most often, graylisting doesn't work because there are no domain directories.  spamdyke is
designed to allow some flexibility when configuring graylisting, so you can enable it for
some domains and disable it for others.
</p><p>
As of version 4.0.0, spamdyke can automatically create domain directories as they are needed.
To enable this, look at spamdyke's <code>graylist-level</code> option.  If it is <code>always</code>,
change it to <code>always-create-dir</code>.  If it is <code>only</code>, change it to
<code>only-create-dir</code>.
</p><p>
To enable graylisting for a domain without enabling automatic directory creation, you must create
a directory within your graylist directory named for the domain you want to graylist.  For
example, suppose you created a graylist directory:
<dl>
<dd><code>/home/vpopmail/graylist.d</code>
</dl>
Then you ran spamdyke with a command line like this:
<dl>
<dd><code>/usr/local/bin/spamdyke -g /home/vpopmail/graylist.d ...</code>
</dl>
No graylisting will take place.  To enable graylisting for the domain <code>example.com</code>, you must also create
another directory:
<dl>
<dd><code>/home/vpopmail/graylist.d/example.com</code>
</dl>
Once you've done that, graylisting will begin for all recipients within the <code>example.com</code>
domain.  Create a directory for each domain you want to graylist.
</p><p>
spamdyke can automatically catch configuration problems like this.  See the <a href="README.html">README page</a>
for details.

<a name="TROUBLE2"></a>
<h2>I want to use spamdyke but some of my users roam and connect from strange
places.  How can I allow them to send email but still filter spam?</h2>
<p>
As of version 2.5.0, this is no problem.  spamdyke understands SMTP AUTH, so
it can authenticate your users and bypass all of its filtering just for them.
Bonus: spamdyke will provide SMTP AUTH even if your qmail has not been
patched to provide SMTP AUTH!
</p><p>
See the <a href="README.html">README page</a> for complete details.
</p>

<a name="TROUBLE3"></a>
<h2>I installed spamdyke and now I'm seeing a lot of timeouts in my logs.  Why?</h2>
<p>
Badly written software on the remote hosts.  It seems a lot of spam software
doesn't handle error codes at all.  It just attempts delivery and expects
success.  When an error code is sent, the software just sits and waits for the
success code it wants.  Eventually, the connection times out.  Sometimes, a
remote server will take a long time to begin delivering a large (legitimate)
message, which can cause timeouts.
</p><p>
qmail enforces a 20 minute idle timeout but it does so silently (no logging).
It's possible you were already getting timeouts and just didn't know it until spamdyke began
logging them.
</p><p>
If you suspect legitimate connections are timing out, there are two things you
can do.  First, you can increase or disable spamdyke's timeouts.  Of course,
qmail's 20 minute idle timeout will still apply but at least you'll be back
where you were before.
</p><p>
Second, you can use spamdyke's full logging feature to log all incoming
connections to files.  The log files contain timestamps so you can see how
quickly the remote server is sending data and where it's stopping.  Hopefully
that will yield some clues you can use to fix the problem.
</p>

<a name="TROUBLE4"></a>
<h2>I installed spamdyke and now my server is very slow!  Incoming connections
have to wait 20 seconds or longer before they see the greeting banner.  What
can I do speed it up?</h2>
<p>
Most often, delays like these are due to DNS traffic.  Depending on the enabled filters,
spamdyke can perform the following DNS queries for <u>each</u> incoming connection:
<ol>
<li>Find the reverse DNS name for the remote server
<li>Find the IP address for the remote server's reverse DNS name
<li>Check the realtime whitelists for TXT records matching the remote server's IP address
<li>Check the realtime whitelists for A records matching the remote server's IP address
<li>Check the realtime blacklists for TXT records matching the remote server's IP address
<li>Check the realtime blacklists for A records matching the remote server's IP address
<li>Check the righthand-side whitelists for TXT records matching the remote server's rDNS name
<li>Check the righthand-side whitelists for A records matching the remote server's rDNS name
<li>Check the righthand-side blacklists for TXT records matching the remote server's rDNS name
<li>Check the righthand-side blacklists for A records matching the remote server's rDNS name
<li>Check the righthand-side whitelists for TXT records matching the sender's domain name
<li>Check the righthand-side whitelists for A records matching the sender's domain name
<li>Check the righthand-side blacklists for TXT records matching the sender's domain name
<li>Check the righthand-side blacklists for A records matching the sender's domain name
</ol>
That's a lot of queries.  If your DNS servers aren't fast enough to keep up, you're
going to see delays in spamdyke.  To alleviate this, try installing a caching nameserver
on your mail server.  If you still see delays, begin disabling DNS-based filters until
spamdyke begins running faster.
</p><p>
If you have disabled all of the filters and spamdyke is still running slowly, you may
have found a bug.  Please report it!
</p>

<a name="TROUBLE5"></a>
<h2>I use spamdyke to prevent relaying (because my qmail isn't patched to provide
SMTP AUTH) but SpamAssassin has stopped scanning incoming messages.  What gives?</h2>
<p>
You must be using qmail-scanner from <a href="http://qmail-scanner.sourceforge.net/">qmail-scanner.sourceforge.net</a>.  That
package has an interesting flaw: it assumes any time the environment variable
<code>RELAYCLIENT</code> is set, no scanning should be performed.  When spamdyke prevents
relaying, it always sets that variable to keep qmail from interfering with its
relaying decision.
</p><p>
To reenable scanning, modify your /etc/tcp.smtp file and add <code>QS_SPAMASSASSIN</code>
to all of the connections you want scanned.  For example:
<dl>
<dd><code>127.:allow,RELAYCLIENT="",QMAILQUEUE="/var/qmail/bin/qmail-scanner-queue"</code>
<dd><code>:allow,QMAILQUEUE="/var/qmail/bin/qmail-scanner-queue",QS_SPAMASSASSIN=""</code>
</dl>
Rebuild the CDB file with <code>qmailctl cdb</code> and you should be fine.
</p>

<a name="TROUBLE6"></a>
<h2>My logs contain the message <code>ERROR: unable to write X bytes to file descriptor 1: Broken pipe</code>.
What does it mean?</h2>
<p>
The message means spamdyke was trying to send some data to the remote server, but the connection
was closed before all of the data was sent.  This can indicate a problem (which is why spamdyke
logs it) but most often it indicates a spammer's server disconnected as soon as it received an
error message.
</p><p>
This error is usually safe to ignore.  You can prevent it from being logged by lowering spamdyke's
<code>log-level</code> setting.
</p>

<a name="TROUBLE7"></a>
<h2>When I use the <code>config-test</code> feature on my Plesk server, the SMTP AUTH
tests always fail.  But I know authentication works, so what's wrong?</h2>
<p>
Plesk uses a program called <code>relaylock</code> to provide some of the features spamdyke
includes.  One of <code>relaylock</code>'s jobs is to offer (and probably process) SMTP AUTH.
</p><p>
However, <code>relaylock</code> won't offer SMTP AUTH to connections that come from the
local host.  It uses the <code>TCPREMOTEIP</code> environment variable to determine the
IP address of the connecting server.  Try setting it to something other than the localhost
IP.  Within the bash shell, you can use this command:
<dl>
<dd><code>export TCPREMOTEIP=11.22.33.44</code></dd>
</dl>
Within the zsh shell, this command will work:
<dl>
<dd><code>setenv TCPREMOTEIP 11.22.33.44</code></dd>
</dl>
If the <code>TCPREMOTEIP</code> environment variable isn't set at all, spamdyke should
set it to <code>0.0.0.0</code> before it starts its tests.
</p>

<a name="TROUBLE8"></a>
<h2>Why isn't spamdyke blocking messages from some blacklisted servers/senders/recipients?</h2>
<p>
Most likely, the problem is TLS.  If the remote server is using TLS to encrypt its transmission
and spamdyke doesn't have access to the certificate (using the "tls-certificate-file" option),
spamdyke can't decrypt the traffic to monitor the entire connection.  In that situation, spamdyke
will not block the connection if there is any chance it could be allowed.
</p><p>
For example, if the remote server should be blocked because its IP address is blacklisted, spamdyke
normally won't reject the connection until it has exhausted every opportuntity to be allowed.  If
SMTP AUTH is possible, spamdyke must wait to see if the server authenticates.  If sender or
recipient whitelists are in use, spamdyke must wait to see if any of those whitelists are matched.
However, when TLS is in use and spamdyke can't decrypt the traffic, the SMTP AUTH, the sender and
the recipient will all be hidden.  spamdyke must allow the connection to continue just in case.
</p><p>
Most of the time, when qmail provides TLS for a connection, it will use the text
<code>(DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA encrypted)</code> in the <code>Received</code> header entry it adds to
the top of the message.  If you see that text in the headers of messages that spamdyke should be
blocking, TLS is the issue.  Change spamdyke's configuration so it can decrypt the TLS traffic
and it will block the connections.
</p>

<h2>I can't figure out why spamdyke isn't working correctly -- some features are malfunctioning in
strange ways <b>OR</b> I'm seeing strange/impossible error messages in my logs.  What's wrong?</h2>
<p>
Of course, the most likely explanation is a configuration problem.  The <code>config-test</code>
feature can help find common mistakes.  You may also have found a bug in spamdyke.
</p><p>
However, occassionally very strange malfunctions/errors are reported that no one is able to explain.
In those cases, the culprit often turns out to be low memory.  Many qmail installations use DJB's
<code>softlimit</code> program to limit the amount of memory that can be used by a single connection.
The limit must allow enough room for spamdyke, qmail and any other filters that have been added.
If the limit is too low, the results are often strange behavior instead of the "out of memory" errors
you might expect.
</p><p>
If you're seeing strange malfunctions/errors and you suspect memory might be the issue, first try
setting it to a ridiculously high value for a short time.  If the malfunctions/errors stop, you've
found the cause.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a good way to determine what the limit should be.  Some tutorials recommend
10 MB, others 40 MB or even 80 MB.  Some guides recommend using trial-and-error to find a limit
where everything appears to work, then doubling it.
</p><p>
Good luck!

<h2>Why are messages still being rejected even after I've added the sender's domain name to my rDNS whitelist? <b>OR</b>
Why aren't message being rejected after I've added the sender's domain name to my rDNS blacklist?</h2>
<p>
The rDNS white/blacklist works by matching the remote server's reverse DNS name (the name that is found by querying
the remote server's IP address through the DNS system).  The sender white/blacklist works by matching the sender's email address.
</p><p>
In other words, they're not the same thing at all.  It's very common for reverse DNS names to be different than
the email domain name, even in the case of large companies.  To allow or block connections based on reverse DNS names (i.e.
the "origin_rdns" value in spamdyke's log messages), add the name to the rDNS whitelist or blacklist.  To allow or block connections
based on email domain names (i.e. the "from" value in spamdyke's log messages), add the name to the sender whitelist or blacklist.
</p>

<a name="TROUBLE11"></a>
<h2>I enabled the IP-in-rDNS filter, so why isn't spamdyke blocking connections from servers
with rDNS names that contain IP addresses?</h2>
<p>
The IP-in-rDNS filter requires two things to block a connection: the rDNS name must contain the IP address <b>AND</b>
the rDNS name must contain a keyword.  For example, consider the following rDNS name:
<dl>
<dt><code>11.22.33.44.dynamic.example.com</code></dt>
</dl>
Obviously it contains an IP address (11.22.33.44), but that's not enough to trigger the filter.
If the keyword <code>dynamic</code> were supplied, spamdyke would block the connection.

However, note that the keyword <code>example</code> would not be matched.  This is because <code>example</code>
is part of the last two segments of the domain name.  spamdyke will not search for keywords there because
that would lead to lots of false positives.  It is possible to use a domain name as a keyword, if it is
prefixed with a dot.  For example:
<dl>
<dt><code>.example.com</code></dt>
</dl>
All connections would be blocked where the rDNS name contained the IP address and the name ended in <code>.example.com</code>.

<h2>I'm trying to run spamdyke's <code>config-test</code> feature but it only says "Missing qmail-smtpd command".  What's wrong?</h2>
<p>
qmail is a strange beast.  Since it's essentially unmaintained, lots of different distributions and patch sets have been
produced to add various capabilities.  In fact, spamdyke's primary purpose is to provide missing capabilities without requiring
qmail to be patched or recompiled.
</p><p>
However, not all of spamdyke's filters are needed (or even appropriate) for everyone, depending on exactly what each particular qmail installation
can do.  For that reason, spamdyke's <code>config-test</code> feature interrogates qmail to see what it can do, then makes
recommendations based on what it sees.
</p><p>
In order to check qmail, spamdyke needs to know the command that is used to start qmail (with all arguments).
The error "Missing qmail-smtpd command" means the qmail command isn't being supplied on the command line, so spamdyke can't
start qmail and check it.
</p><p>
The correct way to use <code>config-test</code> is to find the full spamdyke/qmail command line in your "run" file (or xinetd config file)
and run it after adding <code>--config-test</code> near the beginning.
